    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2016/01/30/building-on-boot/">Building On Boot</a>, I gave some high level benefits we&rsquo;d found with Boot, compared to Leiningen, and how it had helped up streamline our build process. That article closed with a note about Boot not having the equivalent of common Leiningen plugins, and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to cover here, since that was the first real obstacle we encountered.<!-- more --></p>

<p>We use <a href="http://jayfields.com/expectations/">Jay Fields' Expectations</a> library very heavily for most of our testing needs. We use <code>clojure.test</code> only for our <a href="https://github.com/semperos/clj-webdriver">Clojure-powered WebDriver testing</a>. Leiningen has a <code>test</code> task built-in and we had been using <a href="https://github.com/gar3thjon3s/lein-expectations">lein-expectations</a> for years. It was quite a shock to find out that Boot has no testing tasks built-in!</p>

<p>Boot&rsquo;s standard for driving <code>clojure.test</code> is <a href="https://github.com/adzerk-oss/boot-test">Adzerk&rsquo;s boot-test</a>. Using it in your <code>build.boot</code> file is as simple as adding a dependency on <code>[adzerk/boot-test "1.0.7" :scope "test"]</code> and then referring in the <code>test</code> task:</p>

<pre><code>(merge-env! :dependencies '[[adzerk/boot-test "1.0.7" :scope "test"]])
(require '[adzerk.boot-test :refer [test]])
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can do <code>boot test</code> and run any tests in any of the namespaces in your source paths. Unfortunately there was no equivalent for Boot so this was my first chance to roll up my sleeves and write a Boot task as a standalone project. The result is <a href="https://github.com/seancorfield/boot-expectations">boot-expectations</a>. Add a dependency on <code>[seancorfield/boot-expectations "1.0.5" :scope "test"]</code> and then refer in the <code>expectations</code> task:</p>

<pre><code>(merge-env! :dependencies '[[seancorfield/boot-expectations "1.0.5" :scope "test"]])
(require '[seancorfield.boot-expectations :refer [expectation]])
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can do <code>boot expectations</code> to run any Expectations tests in any of the namespaces in your source paths. Do <code>boot expectations -h</code> to see all the options the task provides.</p>

<p>I relied very heavily on two sources for this project: Adzerk&rsquo;s <code>boot-test</code> for the shape of the code and the <a href="https://clojurians.slack.com/messages/boot/">#boot channel</a> on the <a href="http://clojurians.net">Clojurians Slack</a> where Boot&rsquo;s maintainers hang out and are <em>extremely attentive and helpful</em>! In particular, <a href="https://github.com/micha">Micha Niskin</a> was invaluable, answering all my newbie questions and making suggestions. Boot&rsquo;s &ldquo;pods&rdquo; made it easy to specify the version of Clojure to use when running the tests, without affecting the version of Clojure used for anything else in the build process (we have always run our tests against the released version we are actually using as well as the latest snapshot of Clojure&rsquo;s master branch so we don&rsquo;t get surprised by any changes being introduced in the next release). The &ldquo;pod&rdquo; machinery also made it straightforward to have namespaces required into the testing environment, and shutdown functions run after the tests, again without affecting the main build process. And all in a single JVM process that runs for the duration of the build.</p>

<p>As you can see on Boot&rsquo;s wiki, the ecosystem of <a href="https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki/Community-Tasks">community-maintained Boot tasks</a> is already pretty strong and growing all the time.</p>

<p>Back to our build process and one of the key drivers for looking at Boot in the first place: we&rsquo;d hit around 30K lines of production Clojure and 10K lines of test Clojure code, and we had it in three fair-sized projects with Leiningen. We wanted to reorganize the code and break it up into many more projects in order to have more flexibility in how we deploy code as well as being able to develop and test smaller chunks of code in isolation. We also wanted to be able to &ldquo;pin&rdquo; versions of certain libraries that we depended on across multiple &ldquo;projects&rdquo;. With Leiningen we&rsquo;d had multiple <code>project.clj</code> files and were already finding that we were pushing the declarative envelope of Leiningen by having to escape executable code into our <code>defproject</code> form. It felt like we were starting to fight the build tool. The declarative nature of <code>project.clj</code> didn&rsquo;t feel natural for the more fluid approach we wanted to take with our code base. What appealed about Boot was the possibility of a single <code>build.boot</code> file that could mix'n'match source and test code from various locations to allow the more modular develop / test approach we were aiming for, while still being able to easily build, push, and depend on artifacts from sub-projects. With Leiningen, we had a project for our WebDriver tests and it depended on a JAR built from the main source code project, so we would build and install (locally) a JAR of our main project, as part of the build. With Boot and a single <code>build.boot</code> file it was much easier to set up execution and test &ldquo;contexts&rdquo; as tasks that built the list of dependencies and source paths needed for each testing task. We now have all our Clojure code as &ldquo;sub-projects&rdquo; but can treat it as a single project too where that is more convenient.</p>

<p>In the next post, I&rsquo;ll take a diversion from World Singles' use of Boot and look at the <a href="https://github.com/seancorfield/boot-new">Boot new</a> project I&rsquo;ve been working on for a month &ndash; another &ldquo;missing piece of the ecosystem&rdquo; that I wanted to help fill!</p>

    <id>http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2016/01/30/building-on-boot</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In yesterday&rsquo;s blog post, <a href="http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2016/01/29/rebooting-clojure/">Rebooting Clojure</a>, I talked about our switch from Leiningen to Boot but, as Sven Richter observed in the comments, I only gave general reasons why we preferred Boot, without a list of pros and cons.</p>

<p>Over the coming weeks, I&rsquo;ll write a series of posts about some of the specifics that worked better for us, as well as some of the obstacles we had to overcome in the transition.</p>

<p>In this post, I&rsquo;m going to cover some of the pros at a high level as it improved our build / test process.<!-- more --></p>

<p>I mentioned that we&rsquo;d evolved a fair size Ant script over time that does most of the heavy lifting of our build / test / deploy process. We&rsquo;d gradually been replacing parts of that process with Clojure code but it was easier to stick a <code>-main</code> function in certain namespaces to call into our code than to turn chunks of our code into Leiningen plugins. A case in point was our database and data migration tasks. We have developed a persistence layer in Clojure, built on top of <a href="https://github.com/clojure/java.jdbc">clojure.java.jdbc</a>, that encapsulates our connection pooling strategies and environment settings. Our migration code was built on top of that. Our Ant script invoked Leiningen to run these <code>-main</code> functions at various points. With each of these, we had repeated code to deal with command line arguments, process and environment set up, and then calls to what were, in effect, a series of &ldquo;tasks&rdquo;.</p>

<p>With Boot, we were able to eliminate a lot of that boilerplate. Boot tasks have command line argument parsing built-in. There&rsquo;s no need to create a <code>-main</code> function &ndash; the Boot tasks can call directly into our code. At this point we could easily compose tasks in a pipeline to satisfy any combination of database and data migration scenarios we needed, and we could simplify our Ant script to run a pipeline of Boot tasks as needed: which also meant we only fired up one JVM for that whole part of our build, instead of multiple invocations of Leiningen, each invoking a <code>-main</code> function.</p>

<p>We also have some CFML applications in the mix. Because history. We had several tasks accessible via HTTP requests into those CFML applications and those were also invoked by the Ant script because it was easy to do. Over time, we&rsquo;re committed to moving more and more of the CFML functionality down into Clojure (for what I hope are obvious reasons). Some of the tasks we were invoking via HTTP in Ant were already just thin CFML veneers over Clojure functionality, fortunately, so we were easily able to create a Boot task to call that functionality instead of going through CFML via HTTP.</p>

<p>Could we have done all this with Leiningen and plugins? Perhaps. Our experience with writing Leiningen plugins at this point had discouraged us from large scale plugin development. We were able to achieve more in a couple of weeks with Boot than we&rsquo;d able or willing to attempt with Leiningen in a long time.</p>

<p>There were cons too, of course, and the biggest was that several of Leiningen&rsquo;s built-in tasks and popular plugins, on which we relied heavily, were either absent or extremely different with Boot. I&rsquo;ll cover some of those in my next post.</p>

    <updated>2016-01-29T14:30:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2016/01/29/rebooting-clojure</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We switched from <a href="http://leiningen.org/">Leiningen</a> to <a href="http://boot-clj.com/">Boot</a>. What is Boot and why did we switch?<!-- more --></p>

<h2>Leiningen</h2>

<p>Before we talk about Boot, let&rsquo;s first talk about Leiningen. Leiningen describes itself as being &ldquo;for automating Clojure projects without setting your hair on fire&rdquo; and claims to be &ldquo;the easiest way to use Clojure&rdquo;. Rightly so. Leiningen hides all of the messy Maven-y dependency stuff, makes it drop-dead simple to package your applications and libraries as JAR files, makes it easy to run Clojure and provides a nice REPL experience, as well as integrating well with all the editors that Clojurians enjoy.</p>

<p>For a long time, Leiningen was the only game in town, and when we started using Clojure at World Singles, it was the fundamental basis of everything we did with parentheses. We started with a 1.x version of Leiningen, we upgraded to 2.x and we constructed a fair bit of our build / deploy / execute chain around it.</p>

<p>We wrote a couple of Leiningen plugins to deal with some &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; use cases in our environment: one to copy just dependencies to a specific target folder, one to set up a browser environment to run multiple <a href="https://github.com/semperos/clj-webdriver">clj-webdriver</a> tests in a single browser session.</p>

<p>Over time we evolved a fairly large Ant script and a bunch of shell scripts but we really wanted to do more of that automation with Leiningen &ndash; since it&rsquo;s all about &ldquo;automating Clojure projects&rdquo; &ndash; but the reality of writing Leiningen plugins for general automation doesn&rsquo;t quite live up to the promise. Between the declarative nature of <code>project.clj</code> and overall framework in which plugins must execute, there&rsquo;s a lot more than just &ldquo;writing Clojure&rdquo; and there are evaluation restrictions around the processes. Bottom line, we just didn&rsquo;t get as far as we&rsquo;d have liked with Leiningen.</p>

<h2>Early Boot</h2>

<p>Going back to the second ever <a href="http://www.clojurebridge.org/">ClojureBridge</a> workshop. I was organizing this and at teacher training we were going over the curriculum that had been built for the first workshop and it used an early version of Boot. Unfortunately, it was a very rough experience and virtually unusable on Windows. As my first exposure to Boot, it was less than ideal and it put me off exploring it any further.</p>

<p>Looking back, I&rsquo;m sure Boot was well-designed from the start and the design choices made were all solid &ndash; Boot was created by some very smart people &ndash; but I was less than charitable about Boot and unnecessarily vocal. I didn&rsquo;t take Boot very seriously.</p>

<h2>Boot 2.5.0</h2>

<p>Coming back to the present, Boot 2.5.0 was released in mid-December 2015. I owed it a serious second look. I was impressed. For starters, the installation process had become hella slick and the documentation looked really good. My early exploration was to try Boot on Windows 10, Mac OS X, and Linux for both the REPL experience and the basic project build process. One of the most striking differences from Leiningen was that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just Clojure&rdquo;: the build script is straightforward executable Clojure, and tasks are just functions, and everything is based on an abstraction of a fileset. Another striking difference is that composability is baked right into the core of Boot: tasks are like Ring middleware and can wrap each other in a pipeline that allows tasks to take control both before and after other tasks in the pipeline.</p>

<p>After a promising &ldquo;first look&rdquo;, I decided to convert a couple of our core processes to run under Boot so that I could see what a real <code>build.boot</code> would look like in our environment. The only fly in the ointment for us was that Boot uses a single JVM and we were used to being able to compute our JVM options in <code>project.clj</code> (inside the first Leiningen JVM) for use by the application JVM (Leiningen&rsquo;s second JVM). By contrast, Boot uses environment variables to set up a single JVM environment and is a minimal intrusion itself. Boot further mitigates its own intrusion by allowing you execute code in a &ldquo;pod&rdquo; with its own isolated dependencies.</p>

<p>We opted for a wrapper shell script to deal with our JVM environment computation. Once we had that in place, having just a single JVM up and running was a win all round: every process started up faster, our task and automation code was simpler.</p>

<p>We decided on a two week spike to replace Leiningen with Boot across our entire project, and lift all of our executable processes up as Boot tasks. As of January 21st, we have Boot as an integral part of our production infrastructure. We&rsquo;re happy.</p>

<p>In the next blog post, I&rsquo;ll talk about some of the specifics in our Boot infrastructure and the tasks we&rsquo;re writing. As a teaser, you can look at <a href="https://github.com/seancorfield/boot-expectations">boot-expectations</a> and <a href="https://github.com/seancorfield/boot-new">boot-new</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2016/01/03/where-did-2015-go/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-03T08:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2016/01/03/where-did-2015-go</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I did not intend to stop blogging in 2015 but that&rsquo;s certainly what it looks like here!</p>

<p>So what kept me so busy that I didn&rsquo;t get around to blogging anything?<!-- more --></p>

<p>Almost a year ago, I <a href="http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2015/02/13/frege-and-clojure/">talked about my Leiningen plugin for Frege</a>. Back then it was version 3.22.367. That plugin is now version 3.23.450 and there&rsquo;s a Leiningen template to go with it, tracking prerelease builds of Frege which I&rsquo;ve been publishing to Sonatype&rsquo;s OSS Snapshots repository.</p>

<pre><code>lein new frege myapp
</code></pre>

<p>That will generate a new, pure Frege project for you to build on. If you want a mixed Frege and Clojure project, like the original concept:</p>

<pre><code>lein new frege myapp -- :with-clojure
</code></pre>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t gotten to work with Frege as much as I&rsquo;d hoped but I managed to contribute ports of two very small Haskell 2010 libraries (<code>System.Environment</code> and <code>System.Exit</code>) as well as exposing a few more pieces of Java&rsquo;s <code>Runtime</code> class in Frege&rsquo;s <code>java.lang.System</code> data type. I hope 2016 will bring a lot more Frege to my life!</p>

<p>In that blog post, I also talked about learning a new language every year. I mentioned <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>: I&rsquo;d experimented with it quite a bit in its early days and I&rsquo;d hoped to continue experimenting, but work and life distracted me from front end concerns and I lost touch with Elm&rsquo;s evolution. All I can say is that Elm continues to go from strength to strength, and it is gaining more press inches and more visibility at conferences, which is all good. It&rsquo;s truly innovative and I want to see it succeed! I did however spend quite a bit of time learning a little <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> and it makes me wish I did a lot more close-to-the-metal programming: it&rsquo;s a <em>really</em> nice language and the &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; system is very impressive (even if you find yourself fighting with it a lot at first!).</p>

<p>In the past, I&rsquo;ve also blogged about almost every conference I&rsquo;ve attended so you would be forgiven for thinking I didn&rsquo;t attend any events in 2015. I was able to attend The Strange Loop and Clojure/conj this past year. I would have loved to have attended Clojure/West as <a href="http://clojurewest.org/speakers#fhanreich">my colleague Fumiko gave a talk about HoneySQL</a>. That link will evaporate when this year&rsquo;s conference comes around but you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alkcjyhesjI">watch Fumiko&rsquo;s talk about HoneySQL</a> on ClojureTV. It was her first ever conference talk and she did a great job &ndash; I&rsquo;m very proud of her! Oh, she also likes Elm.</p>

<p>Fumiko and I worked on a project with ClojureScript, <a href="http://reagent-project.github.io/">Reagent</a> &ndash; a ClojureScript wrapper for <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React.js</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ptaoussanis/sente">Sente</a> &ndash; core.async over WebSockets. It was a lot of fun and very interesting. It was a proof of concept but, in the end, our company decided to go with JavaScript as being more mainstream (but still with React.js so, win!).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thestrangeloop.com/">The Strange Loop</a> was its usual amazing self. Alex Miller and his team manage to excel themselves, year-on-year. The keynote talks were <em>phenomenal</em> this year with Idalin Bob&eacute;&rsquo;s inspiring talk about activism and Morgan Marquis-Boire&rsquo;s terrifying security and espionage talk as the highlights of the whole conference. The &ldquo;theme&rdquo; this year was distributed systems. I think this image sums it up well:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://seancorfield.github.io/images/distributed.jpg" width="600" height="450" title="image" alt="images"></p>

<p>The other highlight for me was a social event: the <a href="http://lgbtq.technology/">LGBTQ in Technology Slack</a> dinner, generously sponsored by <a href="https://codeclimate.com/">Code Climate</a>. The Strange Loop team work hard to ensure the conference is a diverse, welcoming, safe space for everyone and I was excited to be able to organize this dinner with the support of the conference organizers.</p>

<p>That social theme continued at <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/">Clojure/conj</a> in Philadelphia where I was able to spend time with more folks from the LGBTQ in Technology Slack community (and had a lovely dinner at <a href="http://www.thetwistedtail.com/">The Twisted Tail</a> with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/quephird">Danielle</a>. If you&rsquo;re ever in Philly, <em>go to that restaurant</em>!!).</p>

<p>As usual, Clojure/conj was an incredible mix of real world Clojure, academic research, and bleeding edge exploration in industry. One talk made the entire conference worth the cost for me: Bobby Calderwood&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDNPQo9UmJA">From REST to CQRS</a> with Clojure, Kafka (and Samza), and Datomic. The &ldquo;hallway track&rdquo; that followed this talk caused me to miss the last two talks but it was oh so valuable! Fast forward two months and we&rsquo;re starting down the path of Kafka and distributed systems at work. Priceless, as they say. Other highlights were the father and son Engelbergs on Automata, Ram Krishnan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Clojure for Business Teams&rdquo;, Stuart Halloway&rsquo;s keynote &ldquo;Debugging with the Scientific Method&rdquo; (<em>everyone</em> should watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FihU5JxmnBg">this talk</a>), Lee Spector&rsquo;s &ldquo;Genetic Programming&rdquo; talk, and Benjamin Pierce&rsquo;s keynote about formal specifications and generative testing.</p>

<p>And then there was work&hellip;</p>

<p>I love my job, I love my team, and we get to solve some fascinating problems at <a href="http://worldsinglesnetworks.com/">World Singles</a>. The company has a history of using <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html">ColdFusion</a>, although we switched to a Free Open Source Software alternative in 2009 and we&rsquo;ve been running on <a href="http://lucee.org/">Lucee</a> for most of 2015. We started using Clojure in production almost five years ago now (with Clojure 1.3 Alpha 7 or Alpha 8) and we declared it our &ldquo;primary language&rdquo; about a year ago. Since then we&rsquo;ve systematically rewritten code in Clojure as we&rsquo;ve needed to enhance functionality &ndash; definitely a situation where &ldquo;refactor&rdquo; really does mean &ldquo;rewrite&rdquo;. I created a bridge project that allows Cloure to be loaded and run easily inside CFML engines about five years ago and that&rsquo;s continued to evolve. The MVC framework I created in 2009 has continued to evolve as well, with 2015 seeing release 3.1 and 3.5 &ndash; the latter has integrated the Clojure bridge, to enable seamless mixed language projects. We rely heavily on this. Release 4.0 is almost ready for Alpha 1, and focuses on enhancing REST API capabilities.</p>

<p>In addition, we created an OAuth 2 server, mostly in Clojure, to support our REST API, and we&rsquo;ve worked hard to move all of our persistence from CFML&rsquo;s &ldquo;query&rdquo; functionality to a Clojure &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/seancorfield/datamapper">data mapper</a>&rdquo; based on <a href="http://clojure-doc.org/articles/ecosystem/java_jdbc/home.html">clojure.java.jdbc</a>. We closed out 2015 with <em>all</em> of our persistence handled by Clojure, a big win for performance and maintainability!</p>

<p>Our other big change, coming at the tail end of year, was a switch from <a href="http://leiningen.org/">Leiningen</a> to <a href="http://boot-clj.com/">Boot</a> for our primary Clojure build tool. I&rsquo;ll be blogging about this more in due course, but for now I&rsquo;ll just mention the <a href="https://github.com/seancorfield/boot-expectations">Boot task for running Expectations tests</a> and that Leiningen-style templates will be coming to Boot soon&hellip;</p>

<p>Happy 2016!</p>

    <updated>2015-02-13T02:32:18-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2015/02/13/frege-and-clojure</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve often said that I try to follow <a href="https://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer">The Pragmatic Programmer&rsquo;s</a> advice to learn a new language every year. I don&rsquo;t always achieve it, but I try. As I&rsquo;ve settled into Clojure as my primary language over the last several years, I&rsquo;ve made a fair attempt to learn Python, Ruby, Racket/Scheme, Standard ML and more recently <a href="http://elm-lang.org">Elm</a>. I learned that I like Python, I don&rsquo;t like Ruby, Racket/Scheme is &ldquo;just another Lisp&rdquo; (I already have Clojure) and SML is very interesting but not really widely useful these days (it&rsquo;s a great language for learning Functional Programming concepts tho'!). I also spent some time with Go last year (don&rsquo;t like it).</p>

<p>The Elm language is really nice - and useful for building interactive browser-based applications (and games). I&rsquo;ve been meaning to blog about it for quite a while, and I hope to get around to that in due course. Elm is sort of inspired by Haskell, and that&rsquo;s really what this blog post is about. Sort of.<!-- more --></p>

<p>Haskell and I have a strange relationship. I really liked Haskell when it appeared in the early 90&rsquo;s. I hoped it would finally be the language to help Functional Programming go mainstream (I&rsquo;d been dabbling with FP for about a decade by then). It didn&rsquo;t. Sigh. But I continued to dabble with FP - and Haskell - on and off (mostly off) for another couple of decades. I&rsquo;ve occasionally blogged about Haskell (yes, on my old ColdFusion-focused blog it used to crop up about once a year), and I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be able to <em>use</em> Haskell for something more than just playing around. For a long, long time tho', my programming life has been tied to the JVM, for better or worse, and Haskell&rsquo;s standalone nature has meant that I haven&rsquo;t been able to integrate it into my daily stack.</p>

<p>That tie to the JVM is why I learned Groovy, Scala, Clojure - and took them all to production - but haven&rsquo;t really been able to get deeply into Python (much as I like it)&hellip; or poor old Haskell, despite now decades of toying with it.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, Ingo Wechsung likes Haskell enough that he created the <a href="http://www.frege-lang.org">Frege programming language</a> which is &ldquo;a <strong>pure</strong> functional programming language for the JVM in the spirit of Haskell&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s sufficiently similar to Haskell - see <a href="https://github.com/Frege/frege/wiki/Differences-between-Frege-and-Haskell">Differences between Frege and Haskell</a> - that many people consider Frege to be &ldquo;Haskell for the JVM&rdquo;. This makes me happy because I can finally start to use Haskell (sort of) as part of my daily stack and therefore <em>really learn it</em>! Finally!</p>

<p>So why is this post titled <strong>Frege (and Clojure)</strong>?</p>

<p>Given that Clojure is my primary language, what I really want is to be able to use Frege alongside Clojure, writing small routines in Frege that I can call from Clojure. That means I need a way to compile and load Frege code via Leiningen, Clojure&rsquo;s build tool. So I created <code>lein-fregec</code>, a <a href="https://github.com/seancorfield/lein-fregec">Frege plugin for Leiningen</a>, that allows you to compile pure Frege projects, as well as compile and run mixed language Frege / Clojure projects.</p>

<p>Today I released version <del>3.22.324</del> <strong>3.22.367-i</strong> (to match the current version of the Frege compiler), along with two example Leiningen projects (in that same repo) to show how to use <code>lein-fregec</code> for pure Frege projects as well as Clojure / Frege projects. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the mixed language one.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the Frege code:</p>

<pre><code>module Fibonacci where

-- lazy infinite sequence of Fibonacci numbers starting with a, b:
fibs a b = a : fibs b (a + b)

-- lazy infinite sequence of Fibonacci numbers (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, ...):
fibonacci = fibs 0 1

-- let Frege infer the types here (it'll be Int -&gt; Int):
fibn n = head $ drop n $ fibonacci

-- Clojure uses Long by default so this is our public API:
fib :: Long -&gt; Long
fib n = Int.long $ fibn (Long.int n)
</code></pre>

<p>This declares a module (class in the Java bytecode) called <code>Fibonacci</code> which contains four functions. Even tho' Frege is a (very) strongly typed language, you can often omit the types as it will infer them for you. Starting at the bottom, we have <code>fib</code> which is declared to take a <code>Long</code> and return a <code>Long</code> - and will be compiled down to a static method on the <code>Fibonacci</code> class and therefore easily callable from Clojure (or Java). It casts its argument <code>n</code> to an integer, calls <code>fibn</code> on it, and then casts the result to a <code>Long</code> to return it to Clojure. <code>f $ g x</code> is shorthand for <code>f (g x)</code> that avoids the parentheses. <code>fibn</code>, in turn starts with the (lazy infinite) sequence of fibonacci numbers and drops the first <code>n</code> of them (the sequence starts with zero, but I&rsquo;m treating one as the &ldquo;first&rdquo; number) and then returns the first of what&rsquo;s left (the <code>head</code>). Again <code>$</code> means we don&rsquo;t have to write <code>head (drop n (fibonnaci))</code>. The <code>fibonacci</code> function takes no arguments and just calls <code>fibs</code> with the seed values of zero and one. <code>fibs</code> takes two arguments and returns a sequence with the first argument followed by the fibonacci sequence that starts with the second argument. Frege, like Haskell, is a non-strict (lazy) language so <code>fibs</code> isn&rsquo;t really a recursive call, even tho' it looks like it ought to blow the stack. Instead, when it is called, it returns a list whose first element is (the value of) <code>a</code> and whose remaining elements will be evaluated as needed - or rather <em>if needed</em>. Technically, it doesn&rsquo;t even evaluate <code>a</code> unless you actually refer to the value.</p>

<p>What that means is that when <code>fib</code> is called, the cast (from <code>Int</code> to <code>Long</code>) forces evaluation of the call to <code>fibn</code>, which in turn asks for the <code>head</code> of &hellip; the sequence we get by dropping the first <code>n</code> elements of &hellip; that lazy infinite sequence. So we construct the first <code>n + 1</code> elements of the list and then we look at the last one of those, which forces the calculation of that value (yes, the additions are deferred until the value is needed!). We write simple, obvious code that looks like it might be very inefficient but Frege ensures that only the values we actually need are ever calculated - and because of the way the sequence is constructed from previous elements, it means that once we&rsquo;ve calculated the <em>nth</em> number, all the previous ones are essentially calculated and cached for us. This is possible because our functions are <strong>pure</strong> (no side effects).</p>

<p>What about the Clojure code? Since Frege compiles modules to classes and certain functions (with basic Java type signatures) to static methods, we simply import the compiled class and call the function we want:</p>

<pre><code>(ns example.core
  (:import Fibonacci))

... (Fibonacci/fib 13) ...
</code></pre>

<p>We can even play with the code from the REPL:</p>

<pre><code>$ lein do fregec, repl
...
example.core=&gt; (Fibonacci/fib 11)
89
example.core=&gt; (Fibonacci/fib 42)
267914296
example.core=&gt; 
</code></pre>

    <id>http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2014/09/25/the-strange-loop-2014</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I attended <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/">The Strange Loop</a> in St Louis. I attended in 2011 and was blown away. I missed 2012 but attended again in 2013 and was blown away once more. I already have 2015&rsquo;s dates in my calendar. How was 2014?<!-- more --></p>

<p>Yup, blown away again. Alex Miller and his team have created an iconic event that crosses technology boundaries and bridges between academia and industry, to bring some of the brightest minds together to share their ideas. And for attendees too, the opportunity to meet a huge variety of our peers - from novice to expert - in all different technologies, creates an atmosphere of excitement, wonder, and enjoyment.</p>

<p>All the sessions were recorded and have been posted to YouTube. Link at the bottom of this post!</p>

<p>Here are the sessions I attended with brief notes so you can see why I love this conference:</p>

<ul>
<li>Joe Armstrong - The Mess We&rsquo;re In. The creator of Erlang focused on the overwhelming complexity of the systems we are building today, and how they got that way, with a good dose of humor and some quantum mechanics.</li>
<li>Jessica Kerr - Concurrency Options on the JVM. Jessica took us on a whirlwind tour of Clojure, Scala, Java and what they offer the developer (futures, agents, actors, parallel streams, channels, executors etc), with a whimsical (but consistent) analogy of traffic patterns in JVM-town. A great overview with enough detail to be very useful!</li>
<li>Ambrose Bonnaire-Sargeant - Typed Clojure in Practice. We&rsquo;re using core.typed a little at work so I wanted to hear how others were using it in a production environment. After starting out with a practical example of eliminating bugs through gradual typing, Ambrose walked through a case study of CircleCI which has applied core.typed to a substantial amount of their code. It greatly encouraged me!</li>
<li>Julie Lavoie - Analyzing Rap Lyrics with Python. This sounded so off-the-wall I was intrigued - and I&rsquo;m actually a huge fan of early West Coast rap music (although I find the misogyny very hard to take which, again, was something that intrigued me about the talk). Julie&rsquo;s talk looked at numerous pitfalls in the process end-to-end as well as the difficulties in establishing good metrics of sexism. Musical excerpts, lots of data, lots of questions. A fascinating topic!</li>
<li>Amanda Laucher, Paul Snively - Type Systems: The Good, Bad, and Ugly. Honest, opinionated, and somewhat controversial, Amanda and Paul took us on a tour of type systems available in current and future languages. My takeaway: if you don&rsquo;t like static typing, you have probably only used languages with bad or ugly type systems - but we&rsquo;re not quite there yet in terms of capabilities&hellip;</li>
<li>Brian McKenna - Idris: Practical Dependent Types With Practical Examples. &hellip;which was a nice segue into Brian&rsquo;s talk which showed us some of the things that a truly powerful type system can do for us. Idris isn&rsquo;t production-ready yet but it&rsquo;s an exciting glimpse into a future where type systems are powerful, really useful, and relatively painless to use. I&rsquo;ll need to watch this one a few more times, I think.</li>
<li>Leah Hanson - How Julia Goes Fast. I&rsquo;m currently reading <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/7lang/seven-more-languages-in-seven-weeks">Seven More Languages in Seven Weeks</a> and one of those seven is Julia. I haven&rsquo;t gotten to that chapter yet but I wanted to hear more about how it achieves near-C level performance. Leah took us through various implementation details, showing what Julia was capable of. Her passion for Julia was contagious and I&rsquo;m really looking forward to that chapter now!</li>
<li>Stefanie Schirmer - Dynamic Programming at Ease: with Grammars, Algebras, Products. Stefanie showed us a very powerful set of abstractions that can tame a very difficult type of programming algorithm, with reference to real-world analysis of RNA molecules. Like Brian&rsquo;s talk on Idris, I&rsquo;ll need to watch this a few more times to soak it all in.</li>
<li>Stephen Wolfram - Inside the Wolfram Language. Wolfram is a system that has grown to encompass a huge amount of knowledge across many different disciplines, and Stephen was able to give us a preview of their brand new &ldquo;programming language&rdquo; that can query their (very impressive) knowledge engine. Highly entertaining - make sure you watch the video!</li>
<li>Eleanor McHugh - Fun with Go (Unsession). Several friends have raved about Go so, before the conference, I installed it and worked through the built-in &ldquo;Tour of Go&rdquo; and learned a little of the language. In fifty minutes of fun and increasingly wild and wacky code, Eleanor taught me a lot more of Go than the official tour. I found myself repeatedly thinking &ldquo;Wow! I didn&rsquo;t know Go could do that!&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Nada Amin - Programming Should Eat Itself. Meta-turtles, all the way down. Nada explored reflective metaprogramming. I wasn&rsquo;t sure of the &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind this talk, but she proved that the way to really understand an academic computer science paper is to implement the ideas in it yourself.</li>
<li>Evan Czaplicki - Controlling Space and Time: understanding the many formulations of FRP. Evan created the <a href="http://elm-lang.org">Elm programming language</a> as an embodiment of Functional Reactive Programming &ldquo;done right&rdquo;, so I was very interested to get the &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; on this space. Great background for the different types of FRP out there.</li>
<li>Bodil Stokke - PureScript (Maybe This Time We Get JavaScript Right). Bodil was highly entertaining as always, this time live programming a game in PureScript, a Haskell-like language that compiled down to JavaScript. Although it has many surface similarities to Elm, it is a much more lightweight system, which she needed for her use case. Interestingly, she has built a library in PureScript that provides some of Elm&rsquo;s elegant Signal semantics (which she will hopefully open source soon!).</li>
<li>Rich Hickey - Transducers. Drawing parallels with how we describe processes in the real world - as a series of steps to be performed together - Rich showed how transducers allow us to describe processes in Clojure, without needing to specify the format of inputs, outputs, or intermediate results. Coming soon to a Clojure release near you (it&rsquo;s in 1.7.0-alpha2 already).</li>
<li>Ian Davis - The challenges and benefits of a functional reactive frontend. Ian described Prismatic&rsquo;s experiences with a large-scale interactive web application that is built with ClojureScript and Om on top of Facebook&rsquo;s React.js framework. Real world FRP at scale.</li>
<li>Heather Miller - Function Passing Style: Typed, Distributed Functional Programming. The actor model allows use to perform distributed processing by sending data to nodes and getting results back. Heather talk looked at a different model where the data is distributed (rather than the processing) and you send your functions out to the data instead. Having played with distributed function execution in a cluster of Hazelcast nodes, I was left thinking &ldquo;So?&rdquo; but the emphasis on type systems and immutability means I probably missed something important in her talk so I&rsquo;ll have to watch it again.</li>
<li>Elise Huard - Writing a Game in Haskell. I hadn&rsquo;t considered Haskell as a language for writing games but Elise used it to showcase Functional Reactive Programming as the core of her game&rsquo;s engine. She had embarked on the project for a bit of fun and she shared the whole journey with us, from initial curiosity about games, to design, to multiple implementations and the challenges and paths not taken along the way, to the finished game - and a <a href="https://leanpub.com/gameinhaskell">forthcoming book about her experiences</a>.</li>
<li>Aditya Siram - Shen: A Sufficiently Advanced Lisp. Aditya showed us some of Shen&rsquo;s power - building on traditional Lisp values with a powerful macro system and a powerful type system - producing very elegant solutions.</li>
</ul>


<p>Big trends this year? Functional Reactive Programming (in the real world), and Advanced Type Systems (coming soon?).</p>

<p>One final note on the conference: I picked topics that interested / intrigued me without paying much attention to the speakers (because, with a handful of exceptions, I don&rsquo;t recognize most of the speakers listed anyway!) and now I see that over half of the sessions I attended had women speakers. As I noted last year, Alex Miller and his team did a terrific job of <a href="http://corfield.org/blog/post.cfm/the-strange-loop-2013">ensuring a diverse speaker lineup</a> - and did it again this year! I&rsquo;ve been reading some great blog posts from people who attended the conference this year on the <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/news/doubling-down-on-diversity">diversity scholarships</a> that were set up. It shows that we <em>can</em> change things if we try. We still have a long way to go for equality in tech, but The Strange Loop is a great model for us in that area.</p>

    <updated>2014-09-23T23:05:05-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2014/09/23/clojure-in-the-enterprise</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This was originally posted on <a href="http://corfield.org/blog/post.cfm/clojure-in-the-enterprise">corfield.org back in April 2013</a> and I noticed it was recently referenced by Eric Normand in his recent blog post <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/convince-your-boss-to-use-clojure">Convince your boss to use Clojure</a> so I figured it was time to update the article and bring it onto my new blog.</em></p>

<p>A question was asked in early 2013 on a Clojure group on LinkedIn about reasons to migrate to Clojure for enterprise applications in a Java shop. It&rsquo;s a fairly typical question from people in the Java world when they hear the buzz about Clojure, and of course asking the question on a Clojure group garnered a lot of positive responses about why Clojure is a good choice. I didn&rsquo;t feel anyone had really addressed a core aspect of the original question which was, essentially, &ldquo;Why should I, as a Java web developer, using JPA, JSF etc, choose Clojure instead for an enterprise application?&rdquo;.<!-- more --> The key considerations here are &ldquo;enterprise application&rdquo; and &ldquo;Java web devloper, using JPA, JSF etc&rdquo;. Clojure is rightly praised for big data projects, simplified concurrency due to immutable data, and the conciseness of its solutions. The general advice when introducing Clojure to an organization is to take a grass roots approach: use it for some tooling first, or a small low-risk (but perhaps high-profile) project and show how well it works in a Java-dominated world. Then you get more and more developers trying it out and gradually the organization adopts it for more and more projects. It&rsquo;s good advice, and it&rsquo;s often how Clojure has crept into Java shops so far (as opposed to those fast-moving small shops that already have a tendency toward polyglot development).</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel anyone had really talked about how radical Clojure seems to a conservative &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; company that&rsquo;s already bought into the Java way of doing things from top-to-bottom (as indicated by the original poster&rsquo;s references to JPA and JSF). I had a couple of people ask me to turn my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groupItem?view=&amp;gid=1058217&amp;item=ANET%3AS%3A228031575&amp;commentID=129649205&amp;trk=NUS_RITM-title#commentID_129649205">(fairly length) response on the group</a> into a blog post, so I did, and here&rsquo;s the updated version for 2014&hellip;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; in general is extremely conservative about change. Those companies use Java because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;safe&rdquo;: it&rsquo;s pretty much ubiquitous, it&rsquo;s been around for decades, it&rsquo;s easy to hire low-to-mid-range developers, you can outsource it relatively easily. If you have a company that&rsquo;s bought into the whole Java stack and uses Java for &ldquo;everything&rdquo;, you have a deeply entrenched company and it may be extremely difficult to bring Clojure in. You might have some success bringing Scala in - as a &ldquo;better Java&rdquo; - because Scala is less alien to Java developers and the marketing behind Scala is focused on serving the &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; already.</p>

<p>Having talked to a number of Java developers who work in big &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; shops, one of the biggest problems is simply that the average skill level in such shops is often pretty mediocre, especially if some of the work is outsourced (and considered acceptable quality). The processes tend to be old-fashioned, the tooling tends to be years behind the bleeding edge. Even bringing Scala in can be very disruptive and the worst part is you might just end up with Java-in-Scala, without a lot of the benefits of moving to a highly expressive, (partly) functional language.</p>

<p>Clojure is very alien to the average Java developer. If you have a shop full of &ldquo;average&rdquo; Java developers who have grown up only knowing &ldquo;OOP in Java&rdquo;, they will struggle really badly with the functional concepts in Clojure (and Scala - which is why you get Java-in-Scala instead of idiomatic Scala). Unlearning all those OOP habits to write effective functional code is really, really hard for a lot of people. Writing high performance idiomatic functional code can be even harder. Don&rsquo;t underestimate that difficulty! Take away objects, mutable state, variables, loops&hellip; a lot of Java developers are immediately all at sea and have no idea how to solve even basic problems. They&rsquo;ll try to bend Clojure to their OOP way of thinking and they&rsquo;ll most likely fail.</p>

<p>Clojure is great for bleeding edge developers and it is also great for new developers who have not yet learned the bad habits of OOP (conflating state and identity, mutability, loss of data history / time concepts).</p>

<p>Everything that everyone said in the original comment thread on LinkedIn is true: Clojure has many wonderful benefits, you can start with a small, eager team and a high profile but relatively low-risk project, and so on. But don&rsquo;t underestimate the difficulty of getting a conservative organization to switch from the COBOL of the modern era (Java) to something as radical as Clojure currently is, nor the difficulty of retraining your army of low-to-med-range Java-only programmers.</p>

<p>At my company, we first took Clojure to production in mid-2011 and cross-training the team - a small group of developers eager to learn new things - is an ongoing process, slow and steady. We&rsquo;re at 22KLOC in Clojure with over 5KLOC in our test suite, and about 1KLOC of ClojureScript now. That&rsquo;s probably the equivalent of at least 80KLOC of Java (and quite likely north of 150KLOC). We&rsquo;re a small company with a very supportive management team. At this point, almost all new development is in Clojure with maintenance still continuing on the &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; code base (another factor to consider, by the way: what about your existing Java code base?). We love Clojure. It&rsquo;s made development a lot more fun. We&rsquo;re able to solve harder problems, make changes faster, leverage multi-core concurrency more effectively, and we have a much smaller code base to maintain. But we are about as far from &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; as you can imagine, while not actually being a start-up (World Singles has been around for over a decade).</p>

<p>The half dozen paragraphs above are an edited version of what I posted on LinkedIn (and slightly updated from my original blog post) but there&rsquo;s something else I wanted to cover in this post: the mindset of Clojure.</p>

<p>A common question amongst folks new to Clojure, especially those who want to do web development, is &ldquo;Where are the &lsquo;batteries included&rsquo; frameworks?&rdquo;. If you come to Clojure from Ruby on Rails, you&rsquo;ll probably be surprised to see no full-stack web framework. If you come to Clojure from Java, you might be looking for something like Spring (or Hibernate). The Clojure community favors small, composable libraries over opinionated frameworks. If you want to do web development in Clojure, you can pick a library for routing, a library for basic HTTP request/response plumbing, a library for persistence, and so on, and you&rsquo;ll compose those together with your application code to build the solution you like best. For almost every task, Clojure has several libraries, each focused on doing one thing well and an expectation to &ldquo;play nicely with others&rdquo;, mostly through the idiom of building on Clojure&rsquo;s core data structures (mostly maps and vectors, but also sets and the ubiquitous sequence abstraction). For some, this is seen as a lack of structure or a lack of maturity but it&rsquo;s a very deliberate decision by the core of the Clojure community. Instead of just falling into a particular way of doing something, Clojure encourages you to pick'n'mix, focusing on the problem at hand and solving it in the most elegant way, rather than trying to shoehorn your solution into someone else&rsquo;s way of thinking.</p>

<p>A couple of examples from World Singles might illustrate this. We use two different libraries for generating HTML/XML, which have very different approaches. We use <a href="https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer">Selmer</a> to generate HTML emails. We use <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup">Hiccup</a> to generate XML documents that we use with 3rd party web services. Selmer takes mustache-style templates with substitutions for data structures and some embedded control structures. Hiccup takes Clojure data structures and renders them to HTML/XML. For our web service interaction, we tend to have data structures that we want to render to XML so it is more natural to annotate the data with more data and let Hiccup take care of the rendering. With our HTML emails, we want something close to HTML with a controlled set of substitutions, for member profile data etc. Similarly we use two different testing libraries for different situations. We use <a href="https://github.com/jaycfields/expectations">Expectations</a> for most of our testing because we like the language it uses: &ldquo;Expect {some conditions} to be true of {our test expression}&rdquo;. It lets us write very natural, expressive tests. However, for our WebDriver based tests (using <a href="https://github.com/semperos/clj-webdriver">clj-webdriver</a>), we prefer the more assert-based approach of Clojure&rsquo;s built-in testing library (clojure.test). These end-to-end tests are organized in a much more procedural way, asserting certain things about the state of the UI at various points in each scenario we are testing. Finally, we use two different date/time libraries: <a href="https://github.com/stackoverflow/date-clj">date-clj</a> and <a href="https://github.com/clj-time/clj-time">clj-time</a>. The former is great for interacting with data stores since it uses <code>java.util.Date</code> and supports basic date manipulation (adding / subtracting a number of time units). The latter is great for more complex date/time manipulation (midnight-based instants, periods, intervals, range checking) but is based on Joda Time and needs to be explicitly converted to/from <code>java.util.Date</code> at the boundaries.</p>

<p>Clojure&rsquo;s wealth of choices can be overwhelming but it&rsquo;s also very freeing. The &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; often wants a more proscribed way to do things, with more consistent solutions across different teams and different abilities. For more ideas on getting Clojure into your &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; shop, take a look at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WLgzCkhN2g">Neal Ford&rsquo;s Master Plan for Clojure Enterprise Mindshare Domination</a> presentation from Clojure/conj 2011.</p>

    <updated>2014-09-20T20:03:15-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2014/09/20/powered-by-javascript</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first annual <a href="http://www.manning.com/poweredbyjavascript/">Powered by JavaScript</a> conference, organized by <a href="http://www.manning.com/">Manning Books</a>, took place in St Louis this past week. How did this inaugural event work for someone like me who really doesn&rsquo;t JavaScript?<!-- more --></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m fairly public about my dislike of JavaScript - and it&rsquo;s an easy language to take pot shots at. Indeed, in the following two days of <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/">The Strange Loop</a> conference, several speakers reminded us why JavaScript&rsquo;s flaws have led to so much innovation in both the compile-to-JS (&ldquo;altJS&rdquo;) and the native JS framework space. Despite the (many) flaws, JS is ubiquitous and has evolved from a hastily constructed scripting engine to become the powerhouse of the modern web and with Node.js has moved into the server side development space and as a common part of a build chain that touches almost every web development shop, regardless of their core technology.</p>

<p>The conference opened with keynotes from Dan Shaw about Node.js and Tomomi Imura about the state of the mobile web. Tomomi&rsquo;s keynote was particularly interesting, as she went through the evolution of mobile browsers in detail, looking at features and releases of Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Internet Explorer, as well as some of the politics behind the modern &ldquo;browser wars&rdquo;. I always enjoy a keynote that teaches me something practical I can use as well as providing inspiration, and Tomomi scored on both.</p>

<p>Since this was the first year of the conference, I had signed up long before I knew how the schedule would pan out and as the number of speakers announced continued to grow, I was wondering how they would fit everyone into a one day event. The answer turned out to be three tracks of seven sessions each, which made for a lot of difficult choices. Here&rsquo;s what I chose to attend:</p>

<ul>
<li>Steven Luscher - Decomplexifying UI Code with React. Steven did a great job of explaining the motivations and concepts behind React.js. We&rsquo;re just starting to use React.js at World Singles, for an internal application, albeit wrapped up in a ClojureScript framework and I haven&rsquo;t had to suffer through the pain of large-scale JS development, so it was very interesting to hear <em>why</em> this approach helps - declarative and reactive.</li>
<li>Josh Powell - Unravelling the Knot: Client &amp; Testable Client Side Code. One of the authors of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.manning.com/mikowski/">Single Page Web Applications</a>&rdquo;, Josh walked us through a relatively simple example that showed how data dependencies quickly build up and can lead to bugs and offered us a design pattern to address this: a central data store that is updated by all components and which shifts dependencies from a web of component-to-component to a hub'n'spoke architecture of component-to-data. For me it was a nice follow-on from Steven&rsquo;s talk which also dealt with the complexity of dependencies.</li>
<li>Sarah Groff-Palermo - Art.js: Transfigure Data to Create 21st Century Art. Time for a complete shift of gears with a talk that covered emotion and whimsy and what can be grown out of fragmented data with a variety of JS tools and frameworks and some creativity. It was a very engaging talk and it inspires me to be more experimental with some of the visualization tools that I&rsquo;d like to play with but have previously been intimidated by.</li>
<li>Brian Lonsdorf - Fact, Fiction, &amp; Functional Programming. After lunch, Brian took us on a whirlwind tour of monads, functors, and point-free programming in JavaScript, using a web application written in a nearly pure functional style. I was impressed at how far this sort of thing has come in JS, with things like <a href="https://github.com/CrossEye/ramda">Project Ramda</a>!</li>
<li>Mike Mikowksi - Dump Less and SASS: Dynamic CSS Manipulation with JavaScript. This was the real dud of the day. The other author of Single Page Web Applications, Mike was far more interested in telling us how clever he was and how lucky we were to have chosen his session (seriously dude?) than actually showing us anything useful. He made at least one sexist joke, and several other very dodgy comments, and came off as an arrogant jerk. I&rsquo;d heard complaints about his arrogant, sexist behavior in the bar the previous night but was still intrigued by the topic - unfortunately it was a waste of time.</li>
<li>Trek Glowacki - Single Page Applications: The Web&rsquo;s Horseless Carriage. After the break, the conference got back on track with a fascinating look at the evolution of web applications and how we talk about them, positing that &ldquo;Single Page Web Application&rdquo; is a term that indicates we don&rsquo;t really have a handle on what this space is really about - and what it will become.</li>
<li>Marcus Kobler - React.js and the Importance of Isomorphic SPAs. For the last session of the day, I chose another React.js session and it was another good choice. Marcus dug into React.js in more detail than Steven so it was a good progression and I hadn&rsquo;t heard about &ldquo;Isomorphic JavaScript&rdquo; before so that was yet another topic to Google and add pages to <a href="http://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> for later reading!</li>
</ul>


<p>Manning made an excellent choice to close out the conference with a roundtable of JavaScript experts playing what turned out to be a hilarious version of The Newlywed Game which touched on the good and the bad in JavaScript.</p>

<p>In addition, Manning set up a comprehensive library of their books in the lobby of the conference and selected various tweets they liked throughout the day to award free books. I picked up &ldquo;Java 8 in Action&rdquo; for one of my tweets - and I&rsquo;d signed up early enough to get &ldquo;Single Page Web Applications&rdquo; as well as a registration gift so I was very happy with that.</p>

<p>Watch out for Powered by JavaScript 2015!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Adapted from a post I made on my old blog in January, 2014, about the first few workshops being planned.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been an advocate of diversity in IT for a long time. I&rsquo;m very pleased to work in a company that has an above average ratio of female to male employees, as well as very diverse cultural backgrounds amongst our staff. In most tech communities, diversity is pretty low. It&rsquo;s why organizations like <a href="http://railsbridge.org/">RailsBridge</a> and <a href="http://womenwhocode.com/">Women Who Code</a> and numerous others exist. The lack of diversity hurts us all because a homogeneous community doesn&rsquo;t have diversity of thought either: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=diverse+teams+outperform">diverse teams outperform homogeneous teams</a>.<!-- more --></p>

<p>Back in 2012, I became very bothered by the lack of diversity in the Clojure community - it&rsquo;s a lot less diverse than several other communities I&rsquo;ve experienced - and after talking to a few people, I reached out to a former colleague from Macromedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Allen_(software_developer">Sarah Allen</a>) - president of RailsBridge, to see what it would take to get something started to address it. I continued talking to people about the idea of ClojureBridge and was thrilled when Bridget Hillyer, Lynn Grogan, Maggie Litton and others took up the torch to make it happen!</p>

<p>Early in 2014, I was thrilled to announce that ClojureBridge had become a reality: you could <a href="http://clojurebridge.org/">sign up on the web site</a> to get involved, you could <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojurebridge-workshops">join the ClojureBridge Workshops mailing list</a>. And hundreds of people have done that!</p>

<p>ClojureBridge has already run four workshops: Durham, NC; San Francisco, CA; Brisbane, Australia; Minneapolis, MN. More workshops are being planned in Melbourne, Australia; Edinburgh, Scotland; Chicago, IL; Portland, OR; Austin, TX. It&rsquo;s incredible to see the level of interest in this effort to introduce Clojure to more people, and help improve diversity in our community.</p>

<p>With four successful workshops behind us now, we&rsquo;re working to update the <a href="https://github.com/ClojureBridge/curriculum">curriculum</a> to incorporate lessons we&rsquo;ve learned, so that future workshops can be a better experience for students.</p>

<p>The ClojureBridge web site says:</p>

<blockquote><p>ClojureBridge aims to increase diversity within the Clojure community by offering free, beginner-friendly workshops for women.</p>

<p>Our students range from those completely new to programming to professional developers who want to learn more about Clojure.</p>

<p>ClojureBridge is inspired by RailsBridge, and closely models the RailsBridge philosophy.</p></blockquote>

<p>A typical workshop description says:</p>

<blockquote><p>This workshop is intended to reach out to women who are interested in learning programming with Clojure. Men are welcome to come if you find a woman who wants to learn Clojure and come together. ClojureBridge is emphatically queer and trans* friendly.</p></blockquote>

<p>A common question is: why the focus on women? The answer is that there are already plenty of ways guys can learn a new programming language in an environment that is comfortable for them. The whole of IT is a comfortable space for men (and it is particularly so for white cis-het men). Since many male-dominated environments are not comfortable spaces for many women - and many other underrepresented groups - it&rsquo;s important to create a safe, friendly environment in which to encourage new people to learn technology. ClojureBridge has chosen to follow the RailsBridge model in starting out with a focus on workshops for women. I recently spoke with Dr. Kortney Ziegler, founder of <a href="http://www.transhack.org/">Trans*H4CK</a>, about the possibility of a joint workshop with ClojureBridge aimed at the transgender community. I hope to see ClojureBridge workshops run jointly with other groups that advocate for underrepresented groups in technology.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in improving diversity in IT, reach out to a group like ClojureBridge and get involved. Help organize events in your area. Together we can change the face of IT, and our community will grow and our teams will be more productive and more creative!</p>

    <updated>2014-06-20T17:58:34-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2014/06/20/some-thoughts-on-java-8</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Originally posted on <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+SeanCorfield_A/posts/dTiYLDXV5AV">Google Plus</a> on June 14th, 2014.</em></p>

<p><strong>Why Java 8 might win me back&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>I first started doing Java development in 1997. I was pretty invested in this &ldquo;new&rdquo; technology after being initially skeptical with my strong C++ background. I even wrote an editorial in a C++ journal about &ldquo;the new kid on the block&rdquo;, casting aspersions as to whether it had what it would take to become popular. Over time, Java became the juggernaut of corporate development and I actually found it quite refreshing after C++&rsquo;s somewhat obtuse syntax and complexities: Java was a simple language by comparison, with a well-structured, modular library.</p>

<p>At least, it started out that way.<!-- more --></p>

<p>Java and I parted ways around Java 5. I felt the changes were making it more complex without appropriate benefits. I thought generics and metadata were a disaster. I thought autoboxing would lead to sloppy code instead of forcing developers to think carefully about crossing the primitive/object boundary. I was ambivalent about varargs. I quite liked the new for loop and type-safe enums tho'. Java 6 and Java 7 left me cold (sure, the collection stuff was a step in the right direction, but most of the rest just piled complexity on complexity).</p>

<p>As far as I was concerned, Java had lost its way and become a bloated, verbose language that acted as a nursemaid to mediocre enterprise developers. I vowed I&rsquo;d never write Java again and took every opportunity to tell recruiters that whenever they contacted me with great opportunities for Java architect roles.</p>

<p>I went off to Groovy, then Scala, then Clojure. And there I&rsquo;ve stayed for the last three or four years.</p>

<p>When Java 8 was first getting press, I was very skeptical: how could they bring the elegance and ease of functional programming to a language so buried in boilerplate and a verbose, simplistic type system? I liked the simplicity of Groovy (and its dynamic approach to typing), I liked the elegance of Scala (even tho' I found the quirks of its type system and slow compilation to be significant drawbacks), and I really liked Clojure&rsquo;s combination of elegance, simplicity, and dynamic typing.</p>

<p>But, at World Singles, we run our dating platform on the JVM and so an upgrade to Java 8 was inevitable to take advantage of the improvements in heap management and garbage collection. Since I was testing everything on the new JVM, I figured I might as well take a look at Java&rsquo;s new language features&hellip;</p>

<p>And I was pleasantly surprised! Streams providing lazy/efficient map, filter, and reduce. Optional providing a way out of the null-checking tar pit of typical Java code. Lambda expressions providing a huge improvement in expressiveness and conciseness - compared to the ugly anonymous classes and single-method interfaces we&rsquo;d had to put up with before. All those new functional interfaces. Method references. A lot of improvements in the type system and type inference.</p>

<p>In many ways, Java 8 is a whole new language. It&rsquo;s still fairly verbose but its support for functional programming is actually not bad at all. There are still no immutable collections - maybe Java 9 will address that - but streams, lambdas, etc make a huge difference in what you can do with relative ease.</p>

<p>I think I can safely say that I would no longer rather fall on a sword than program in Java - as long as it&rsquo;s Java 8!</p>

<p><em>p.s. No, I&rsquo;m not switching from Clojure, but now I view Java as &ldquo;palatable&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;hideous&rdquo;.</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s very enlightening to look back at the beginning of a project to see how things got set up and how we started down the path that led to where we are today. In this post, I&rsquo;m going to talk about the first ten tickets we created at World Singles as we kicked off our green field rewrite project five years ago.<!-- more --></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been involved with World Singles for about five years now, about three and a half years as a full-time engineer. The project was a green field rewrite of a dating system the company had evolved over about a decade that, back in 2009, was running on ColdFusion 8 on Windows, and using SQL Server. The new platform soft-launched in late 2011 as we migrated a few small sites across and our full launch - migrating millions of members in the process - was May 2012. At that point we switched from &ldquo;build&rdquo; mode to &ldquo;operations&rdquo; mode, and today we maintain a large codebase that is a combination of CFML and Clojure, running on Railo 4.2 on Linux, and using MySQL and MongoDB, running partly in our East Coast data center and partly on Amazon.</p>

<p>Like all projects, it&rsquo;s had some ups and downs, but overall it&rsquo;s been great: I love my team, we love working with Clojure, and we have a steady stream of interesting problems to solve, working with a large user base, on a multi-tenant, multi-lingual platform that generates millions of records of data every day. It&rsquo;s a lot of fun. And we all get to work from home.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s very enlightening to look back at the beginning of a project to see how things got set up and how we started down the path that led to where we are today. In this post, I&rsquo;m going to talk about the first ten tickets we created as we kicked the project off. Eleven if you include ticket &ldquo;zero&rdquo;.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>#0 - Choose a bug tracking / ticketing system. We chose <a href="https://unfuddle.com/">Unfuddle</a>. It&rsquo;s clean and simple. It&rsquo;s easy to use. It provides Git (and SVN) hosting. It provides notebooks (wikis), ticketing, time management, customizable &ldquo;agile&rdquo; task boards, collaboration with external users, and it&rsquo;s pleasing to the eye. I&rsquo;ve never regreted our choice of Unfuddle (even when they did a massive overhaul of the UI and it took us a week or so to get used to the radically new ticket editing workflow!).</p></li>
<li><p>#1 - Version control. Yes, really, this was our first ticket in Unfuddle. The resolution to this ticket says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Selected vcs system (git), created repository in Unfuddle, and provided detailed documentation on why git, how to set it up, how to connect to the repo and how to work with git.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>And the documentation was all there in an Unfuddle notebook for the whole team. A good first step.</p></li>
<li><p>#2 - Developer image. Once we had version control setup and documented, we needed an easy way for every developer to have a full, self-contained local development environment. We had some developers on Windows, some on OS X, some on Linux, so we created a VMWare image with all the basic development tools, a database, a standardized ColdFusion installation, with Apache properly configured etc. This established a basic working practice for everyone on the team: develop and test everything locally, commit to Git, push to Unfuddle. We could then pull the latest code down to a showcase / QA server for the business team to review, whenever we or they wanted.</p></li>
<li><p>#3 - Project management system. Although we had bug tracking and wikis, we wanted to nail down how communication would work in practice. We created a project management mailing list for discussion threads. We created a notebook section in Unfuddle for documenting decisions and requirements. We decided to use Basecamp for more free-form evolution of business ideas. We agreed to use tickets in Unfuddle for all actionable work, and we settled on a Scrum-like process for day-to-day development, with short, regular sprints so we could get fast feedback from the business team, and they could easily see what progress we were making.</p></li>
<li><p>#4 - General project management. Since we had agreed to use Unfuddle for time tracking, we created a ticket against which to track project management hours that didn&rsquo;t fit into any actual work tickets. We used this for the first six months of the project (and logged about 300 hours against it).</p></li>
<li><p>#5 - Performance planning/tuning. This was mostly a placeholder (and initially focused on how to make a Reactor-based application perform better!). It was superceded by several more specific tickets, six months into the project. But it&rsquo;s one of those things we wanted on the radar early for tracking purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>#6 - Architectural planning. Like ticket #4, this was a time tracking bucket that we used for the first six months of the project.</p></li>
<li><p>#7 - Set up Continuous Integration. Yup, even before we got to our first actual coding ticket, as part of the early project setup, we wanted a Continuous Integration server. Whilst we were using ColdFusion for local development (prerelease builds of ACF9, at the time), we chose to use Railo 3.2 for the CI server so that we could ensure our code was cross-platform - we were still evaluating which engine to ultimately go to production with. The resolution of this ticket says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Apache / Tomcat / Railo / MySQL / Transparensee / Hudson in place. Automated test run restarts Railo, reloads the DB, reloads Transparensee, cleans the Reactor project, runs all test suites and generates test results.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>We developed an Ant script that stopped and started Railo, tore down and rebuilt the test database, using a canned dataset we created (with 1,000 random users), repopulated the search engine we use and cleaned up generated files, then ran our fledgling MXUnit test suite (and later our fledgling Selenium test suite).</p></li>
<li><p>#8 - Display About us/trust. This was our first actual code ticket. The company had selected ColdBox, ColdSpring, and Reactor as our basic frameworks (yeah, no ticket for that, it was a choice that essentially predated the project &ldquo;getting started&rdquo;). This ticket was to produce a first working skeleton of the application that could actually display dynamically generated pages of content from the database. We created the skeleton of the site navigation and handlers for each section as part of this ticket. The &ldquo;trust&rdquo; in the ticket title was about showing that we really could produce basic multilingual content dynamically and show an application architecture that worked for the business.</p></li>
<li><p>#9 - Implement resource bundles for templates. And this was also an early key requirement: so that we could support Internationalization from day one and perform Localization of each site&rsquo;s content easily.</p></li>
<li><p>#10 - Display appropriate template for each site. This was our other key requirement: the ability to easily skin each site differently. Like #9, this was an important proof of concept to show we could support multiple sites, in multiple languages, on a single codebase, with easy customization of page layouts, content, and even forms / questions we asked.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So that&rsquo;s how we got started. Bug tracking, version control, local development environment, continuous integration and the key concepts tackled first!</p>

<p>A reasonable question is to ask what has changed in our approach over the five years since. We&rsquo;re still using Unfuddle (in case you&rsquo;re wondering, we&rsquo;re up to ticket 6537 as I write this!), we&rsquo;re still using Git (and still loving it). Our development stack has changed, as has some of our technology.</p>

<p>Over time we all migrated to Macs for development so maintaining the VM image stopped being important: everyone could have the entire development stack locally. We eventually settled on Railo instead of ColdFusion (we&rsquo;re on Railo 4.2 now), and we added MongoDB to MySQL a couple of years ago. We added some Scala code in 2010 to tackle a problematic long-running process (that did a lot of XML transformation and publishing). We added Clojure code in 2011 for a few key processes and then replaced Scala with Clojure and today Clojure is our primary language for all new development, often running inside Railo. We stopped using Reactor (we wrote a data mapper in Clojure that is very close to the &ldquo;metal&rdquo; of JDBC). Recently we stopped using MXUnit and replaced it with TestBox. We&rsquo;re slowing changing over from Selenium RC tests to WebDriver (powered by Clojure). We have about 20,000 lines of Clojure now and our CFML code base is holding steady at around 39,000 lines of Model and Controller CFCs and 45,000 lines of View cfm files.</p>

    <link href="http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2013/05/01/instrumenting-clojure-for-new-relic-monitoring/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-01T20:09:04-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2013/05/01/instrumenting-clojure-for-new-relic-monitoring</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;ve recently started evaluating the <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic monitoring service</a> at World Singles and when you use their Java agent with your web application container, you can get a lot of information about what&rsquo;s going on inside your application (JVM activity, database activity, external HTTP calls, web transaction traces).<!-- more --> For a CFML application tho', all you tend to get in the web transaction traces is the Servlet entry point, some JDBC SQL reports, and some of the low-level Java libraries (if you&rsquo;re lucky!).</p>

<p>However, we have a mixture of CFML and Clojure, running on the <a href="http://www.getrailo.org">free open source Railo server</a> so I thought it might be possible to somehow instrument the Clojure code to enable more visibility into our application traces.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://blog.newrelic.com/2012/11/13/setting-up-custom-instrumentation-using-the-new-relic-java-agent/">New Relic blog post talks about custom instrumentation</a> and shows how you can use method annotations in Java to make specific function calls show up in web transaction traces. (The New Relic documentation, accessible from their monitoring console, provides more detail)</p>

<p>In Java (approximately):</p>

<pre><code>import com.newrelic.api.agent.Trace;

public class Thing {

    @Trace
    public void someMethod() {
        ...
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>So how do you do the same thing in Clojure? Annotations have been supported for quite a while in Clojure but they&rsquo;re very poorly documented and they require some specialized code.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s suppose you have this Clojure code:</p>

<pre><code>(ns my-project.stuff)

(defn some-func [x y z] ...)

(defn another-fn [a b] ...)
</code></pre>

<p>We want to annotate both of these functions so they show up in New Relic web transaction traces. You can add annotations in a <code>deftype</code> so we have to transform our code quite a bit. First off, you&rsquo;ll need the New Relic JAR as a dependency in <code>project.clj</code>:</p>

<pre><code>  :dependencies
    [...
     [com.newrelic.agent.java/newrelic-api "3.10.0"]
     ...]
</code></pre>

<p>Check <a href="http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cnewrelic-api">Maven Central</a> for the latest version! <em>As of September 26th, 2014, it was <code>3.10.0</code>.</em></p>

<p>Then you need to import the <code>Trace</code> annotation:</p>

<pre><code>(ns my-project.stuff
  (:import com.newrelic.api.agent.Trace))
</code></pre>

<p>Since we need to use <code>deftype</code> we need to define an interface type for the functions we want to instrument. We also need to use Java-compatible names. Here&rsquo;s a first cut:</p>

<pre><code>(definterface INR
  (some_func [x y z])
  (another_fn [a b]))
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can define the implementation type with the annotations. Then we&rsquo;ll need to expose a Clojure API based on that. Let&rsquo;s start by renaming our existing implementations and making them private, so we can call them from the <code>deftype</code> with minimal code changes:</p>

<pre><code>(defn- some-func* [x y z] ...)

(defn- another-fn* [a b] ...)
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can write our <code>deftype</code> with annotations:</p>

<pre><code>(deftype NR []
  INR
  ;; @Trace maps to Trace {} metadata:
  (^{Trace {}} some_func  [_ x y z] (some-func* x y z))
  (^{Trace {}} another_fn [_ a b]   (another-fn* a b)))
</code></pre>

<p>Here we have an implementation - <code>NR</code> - of our interface - <code>INR</code> - which provides the two methods. Note that they ignore their first argument (<code>this</code>) because the object type is just an artifact of <code>deftype</code> for us to add the annotations. Finally, we can reimplement our original API in terms of the new type. In order to do that, we need an instance of our type, and to avoid classloader issues, we&rsquo;ll create a new instance in each call. <em>In my original blog post I suggested using a private singleton but later discovered that caused problems with classloaders sometimes.</em></p>

<p>And finally here is our original API reimplemented in a traceable way:</p>

<pre><code>(defn some-func  [x y z] (.some_func (NR.) x y z))

(defn another-fn [a b]   (.another_fn (NR.) a b))
</code></pre>

<p>Now you just need to start your web application container with the JVM option <code>-javaagent:/path/to/newrelic.jar</code> (which is your licensed JAR file downloaded from your monitoring console, not the one pulled in by Leiningen based on the dependency we added above!).</p>

<p>When you drill into web transaction traces, you should see <code>my_project.stuff.NR.some_func</code> and <code>my_project.stuff.NR.another_fn</code> entries in it!</p>
