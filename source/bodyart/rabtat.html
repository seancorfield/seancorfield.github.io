<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"> Last year saw me finally pluck up the courage to 
  get pierced after four years of wanting... Last week I got my first tattoo...</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">+ + + warning! long and meandering post follows! 
  + + +</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">I went to Tattoo Expo last year in Dunstable and 
  had been thinking about a tattoo, probably an anklet, for a while. Pat Fish 
  was there and I looked through her work and liked it so I said that when I was 
  in California in March, I would come by and have something celtic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Time rolled round to March and through a series 
  of email messages I arranged to visit Santa Barbara on the 19th &amp; 20th. 
  Pat recommended a hotel (The Californian on State St - great view and great 
  character) and gave me some good advice on places to see and avoid on my route 
  down the coast from San Francisco. Pat doesn't open Tattoo Santa Barbara on 
  Monday or Tuesday (19th) but said it was OK to drop by and look through her 
  archives for designs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">I make friends with Gnarly and Omi (her &quot;ferocious&quot; 
  dogs happily rolling at my feet - don't be fooled: I also saw them defend the 
  territory... they are serious guard dogs!) and start looking at designs. She 
  has a hell of a collection of material and an amazing shop full of great stuff 
  from all around the world...and some lethal fish too! A border pattern from 
  one of the illustrations in the Book of Kells grabbed me as the main band and 
  I had a few ideas for the larger knot I wanted worked in on the outside of the 
  ankle. Pat suggested dinner and drove me (in her Cadillac hearse... way to go!) 
  to Arnoldi's - a favoured restaurant of hers. Pat's very outspoken and it was 
  entertaining getting to know her having only exchanged a few emails. She delights 
  in telling several people I've come all the way from England to get a tattoo 
  and this is my &quot;last supper&quot; before all the pain! (ulp!)</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Wednesday I wander back to Pat's around 2pm. We 
  finalise the shield knot (from a stone(?) in St Vigeans, Perthshire) and then 
  she copies the design to get the right size and starts applying the transfer... 
  The knot is positioned perfectly first time, but we have several goes at the 
  band - Pat is very patient as I um and ah about whether I'm absolutely happy 
  with the placement. Next she gets a pen and draws the extra loops needed to 
  tie the band and the knot together so they interlock... This takes her some 
  time, working patiently until we're both happy with it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">I draw amusement from the contrast between her patience 
  with me and the design versus her somewhat short responses to some of the folks 
  who wander in... &quot;How much?&quot; is a common question &quot;Depends&quot; 
  says Pat (and there's a sign on the counter answering this very question). She 
  regales me with tales of dumb questions while she's working. A mother comes 
  in with a daughter under 18 who wants a tattoo. Pat says the law won't allow 
  that and the mother should be wary of anyone who will do it (actually she was 
  a *lot* more forceful than that!). The mother is not happy - seems like they'll 
  go elsewhere. Pat says the principle is very important (I agree). Other near-customers 
  include three girls who want triangles tattooed inbetween their toes as a sign 
  of sisterhood. One girl isn't keen so Pat says &quot;Don't do it&quot; - all 
  three go away without triangles.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pat prepares the ink and gun and tells me I'll probably 
  find it easier to watch - it'll keep my mind off the pain(!) So I watch and, 
  much to my surprise, it isn't really painful at all. Well, apart from a couple 
  of moments when she was working over the bone at the front! Pat works fairly 
  solidly for about an hour and half, fending off dumb phone calls and dumb would-be 
  customers as well as dealing patiently with the few people who seem to have 
  thought about it...</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">About 4pm we're done and Pat takes a couple of photos 
  of the finished anklet. I'm very pleased with it, especially the way the band 
  and the knot interlock so smoothly. Pat tells me to drive to Montecito to buy 
  Neosporin and Curel for aftercare (I get Longs own Trisporin - less than half 
  the price of Neosporin but with the same ingredients). Later I wander back to 
  the shop to watch Pat at work on others. When I get there, she's doing a yin-yang 
  on some college girl's foot - the girl accompanied by a host of friends. I sit 
  on the floor and play with the dogs, letting Omi (the Rottweiler) chew my hand 
  (&quot;She's only playing&quot;) Then two chinese girls come in: one wants a 
  butterfly on her ankle, the other a rose on her back. After some discussion, 
  the rose is swapped for a lotus. Pat talks the girls through their choice of 
  colours and then they get their tats. Pat chats away, putting them at ease. 
  One asks me how it compares to body piercing before she goes under the needle 
  - I say my ankle band didn't hurt much... certainly less than my nipple piercings. 
  I suspect the girl may disagree now... sorry :-)</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Afterwards, Pat and I went for dinner again, this 
  time at a great seafood restaurant on the harbour. Good shark! More tales of 
  tattooing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">I leave Santa Barbara with great memories and a 
  great tattoo. Pat's an absolute gem - funny and serious and every inch a professional 
  artist. As a first tattoo experience, I was very impressed and will certainly 
  go back when I'm in the area even if it's only to chew the fat.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanx Pat!</font> </p>
