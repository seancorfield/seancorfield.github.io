      <font face="Comic Sans MS">I first encountered piercing in 1991. I was going 
      out with a girl called Yvette and we were looking for unusual or exotic 
      magazines and found <I>body art</I>. She was into body building and so the 
      aesthetics of the body were important to her. She decided she wanted her 
      nipples pierced and I thought this would look pretty good but we split up 
      before we got around to doing anything about it. I subscribed to <I>body 
      art</I> and the more I read it, the more I wanted a body piercing. But I 
      didn't know anyone else who'd had it done and I didn't know where to go...until 
      I saw an advert for <I><A 
HREF="http://www.into-you.co.uk" TARGET=piercer>Into You</A></I> in London and 
      that made up my mind!<BR>
      <BR>
      It was the start of an ongoing love affair, documented here in full! Some 
      of the diary entries have links to my posts on rec.arts.bodyart and further 
      pictures.<BR>

      I was really nervous but Teena was great and despite nearly passing out 
      twice I was really pleased with the result. The initial piercing was done 
      with 14ga (1.6mm) 5/8&quot; Surgical Stainless Steel Captive Bead Rings.<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

      a lot of fun - guaranteed to stop that disgusting habit of chewing pens! 
      The initial piercing was done with a 14ga SSS barbell.<BR>
      Now that I've stretched up to 8ga (see 14 September 1996 below), I can put

      It didn't take long to decide that I wanted a Prince Albert so on 19 September 
      I went back to <I>Into You</I> to be pierced by Mark (Teena's currently 
      in Burma).<BR>
      This is a 10ga (2.5mm) 3/4&quot; SSS CBR. No anaesthetic. Just a short, 
      sharp poke with a 2.5mm hollow needle -- are you up for it?<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
      Mark also changed my original tongue barbell for a shorter bar: the usual 
      practice once the swelling has gone and the piercing is healed. [<A HREF="rabpa.html">posting

      I accompanied a friend to <I>Into You</I>. She was getting her inner labia 
      pierced so I decided to have my nipples upsized to 12ga (2mm) 5/8&quot; 
      SSS CBRs. Mark did this with an insertion taper and it hurt!<BR>

      I spent most of March in California and arranged to visit Pat Fish of <I><A
HREF="http://www.luckyfish.com/" TARGET=piercer>Tattoo Santa Barbara</A></I> 
      to get my first tattoo. I'd seen Pat's work at Dunstable Tattoo Expo '95 
      and was very impressed. Everyone who's seen my Celtic anklet thinks it's 
      beautiful -- even my anti-tattoo mother! [<A HREF="rabtat.html">posting

      Back to <I>Into You</I>... My nipples are upsized to 10ga 3/4&quot; SSS 
      CBRs. Cushla did this without a taper... it wasn't too bad. Cushla also 
      upsized my tongue barbell from 14ga to 12ga. I decided to upsize because 
      I'd been messing around, hanging things from my tongue bar and had ripped 
      the hole slightly!<BR>

      Reverse Prince Albert by Mark. 10ga 1&quot; SSS CBR. This was the most painful 
      experience of my entire life! (but see 7 September, 1998) [<A HREF="rabrpa.html">posting

      Tragus by Cushla. A small 14ga SSS CBR (see 18 January, 1997). Quite a tough 
      bit of cartilage to pierce... It wasn't exactly painful but it certainly 
      wasn't very comfortable.<BR>

      <font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>29 June, 1996</i><BR>
      Bought a 10ga 5/8&quot; CBR for my septum and a 10ga 12mm long bar for my 
      tongue. Hmm, the 12ga bar was 10mm long so the new bar may take some getting 
      used to but it doesn't feel too different... 8ga here I come! And I finally 
      bought some circlip pliers so I can change my own jewellery instead of bothering 
      those nice people at <I>Into You</I>.<BR>
      Today I recorded an interview for Cyber Cafe -- Meridian Television's programme 
      about the weird and the wonderful on the 'net. About body piercing of course. 
      The programme was shown in August on all independent channels. They've got 
      a web page somewhere. I asked if I could put up screenshots and dialogue 
      - I have the programme on video of course - but they didn't seem keen (they 
      do have a link to this page, however).<BR>

      Finally decided that my right nip ring <I>is</I> migrating and is too far 
      forward for play so I took it out. *sniff*<BR>

      <font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>26 August, 1996</i><BR>
      Went to see Patrick of <A HREF="http://www.bme.freeq.com/pierce/lpcafter.html"
TARGET=piercer>The London Piercing Clinic</A> and he repierced my right nip nice 
      and close to the base of the nip (I have quite big nipples). Same gauge 
      and ring size (10ga) but in titanium. I'm happy again.<BR>
      As an interesting experiment, I let Patrick use anaesthetic - a small injection 
      which seems an odd idea given that it's only to stop you feeling another 
      needle being poked into you! Patrick doesn't use forceps either, preferring 
      to pierce by hand - he says the forceps cause too much tissue trauma. Well, 
      it healed faster than any of my other piercings so I guess you can say it 
      was a successful experiment! Patrick no longer uses anaesthetic though and 
      has now developed a needle "gun" which people say is very effective. [<a href="rabrnip2.html">posting 
      to rec.arts.bodyart</a>]<BR>
      I realise I have a lot of spare rings and wonder what to do with them... 
      idea! I decide to hang them all off my PA ring!<BR>

      <font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>7 September, 1996</i><BR>
      I decide that my left nip is also too far forward for rough play and take 
      that out. What should I do with this 10ga 3/4&quot; ring? Swap it with the 
      12ga 5/8&quot; ring in my left lobe I think... After a struggle, I succeed 
      in stretching it... ow! Which means another ring for my PA collection!<BR>
      1 x 10ga 3/4&quot;, 2 x 12ga 5/8&quot;, 1 x 14ga 5/8&quot;... looks wild!<BR>

      SM Pride and Dungeon in the Sky. Amongst the stalls at ULU is a Wildcat 
      jewellery stall... I can't resist... an 8ga, 12mm tongue bar... with large 
      balls. At last, some internally threaded jewellery! It's a bit of a struggle 
      to get the post all the way through but I manage it and with a little help 
      from two friends get the ball screwed on. Hmm, it certainly feels more solid 
      than the previous bar. Nice. My tongue aches for two days but I'm still 
      happy.<BR>

      Bad news. The weight and movement of the rings on my PA has really irritated 
      it so I concede to good health and remove the rings. Damn! At least it's 
      had the desired effect of stretching the PA hole a bit ready for that move 
      to 8ga...<BR>

      ...but it was still an eye-watering moment when Patrick changed the ring 
      in my PA! It definitely looks better with a thicker ring but it makes the 
      reverse PA looks very thin (see 7 September, 1998). He also swapped the 
      reverse PA ring for a titanium one which should stop the last vestiges of 
      irritation that the slow-healing steel ring was causing.<BR>

      January saw me in California (again) and I took the opportunity to get my 
      left nipple repierced, by Anne "Ardvark" Greenblatt of <I><A
HREF="http://www.piercingexquisite.com/" TARGET=piercer>Piercing Exquisite</A></I>. 
      Anne greeted me with "Ooo, that tragus ring's too small!" and proceeded 
      to change it for a larger diameter ring. After that, she said "Hi, good 
      to meet you!". As expected, I passed out after the nipple piercing... much 
      to Anne's amusement (and later to the denizens of 20 Tank Brewery where 
      the San Francisco bodyart group held a munch!). I also wanted my guiche 
      done but Anne said I wasn't built for it. However...<BR>
      </font> 
      <HR>
      <font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>19 January, 1997</i><BR>
      ...I went back to Anne and persuaded her! She took some photos and I think 
      the best one is <A HREF=guiche2b.jpg>this one</A>. Was I built for it? Well, 
      I've not really had any problems with it - apart from occasionally sitting 
      down a bit too quick and catching it! - and it is quite an erotic piercing.<BR>
      Update: two years on and the guiche has migrated to the right slightly. 
      It's still a bit uncomfortable at times (like, when I sit on it awkwardly) 
      but even riding a motorbike hasn't dislodged it...<BR>

      The guiche and nipple satisfied my urges for a while but less than four 
      months later I was back in the chair. This time at <I>Into You</I> for a 
      hafada. "Big" Katie did this and it was fairly painless. My plan was to 
      have four done, two each side of the scrotum.<BR>
      Unfortunately, my body didn't like this piercing one bit and after only 
      two months of serious migration, I had to give in and take it out :(<BR>

      Arranged to take Anet, one of the girls from the office, along to <I>Into 
      You</I> to get her tongue pierced. Of course, I might as well get something 
      done too so I booked in to get a vertical bar in my right nipple (behind 
      the ring) and an upper cartilage on my right ear. This time it was Cushla 
      again and, apart from using too small a ring on the upper cartilage, as 
      she had on my troublesome tragus the year before, it all went very smoothly.<BR>
      I had to change the cartilage ring myself a few days later (well, I've got 
      loads of spare jewellery) and it has now completely healed (January '98).

      Back to California, this time with my mum for a two week fly-drive. We started 
      in San Francisco so another visit to Anne Greenblatt was in order. This 
      time it was to get my reverse PA stretched to 8ga and to have a rook in 
      my left ear. The stretch was my most painful ever (oh, there's a surprise... 
      pushing a 3.2mm taper through a 2.4mm hole in your glans is bound to be 
      easy, right?). I hyperventilated and lost all the feeling in both hands 
      - which went totally rigid - for about 15 minutes! *sigh*<BR>
      After that, the rook was easy! Apart from a very slight migration of the 
      top (entry) hole, it's been fine and I was able to sleep on it within a 
      few days.<BR CLEAR=ALL>

      Back to California on business (it's a hard life!). This time, Santa Cruz, 
      but it's near enough to San Francisco that I had to visit Anne again! I'd 
      removed my daith in mid-September and wanted it pierced again. Anet moved 
      to Modesto, CA at the end of August to be with (the other) Sean that she 
      met through the 'net so they both came with me. Anet wanted her right nipple 
      done.<BR>
      Anne examined my right ear and decided that there was still some residual 
      infection and advised against piercing it so soon. No daith! I was gutted!<BR>
      Anet had her nipple done and her left one changed to titanium. I had to 
      have <I>something</I> done so we decided to stretch my left earlobe to 8ga 
      (3.2mm). A bit uncomfortable and it was irritable for about a week afterwards 
      but it looks great. I also bought a 6ga ring and a taper for the next stage...<BR>

      <font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>7 November, 1998</i><BR>
      Saturday afternoon, bored. What shall I do? Must be time to stretch that 
      lobe again! I took it much slower with the taper than Anne had (OK, so I'm 
      a wuss!) and it was fairly painless. Actually, the hardest part was opening 
      the ring enough to get the bead back in - my circlip pliers are only just 
      up to dealing with 6ga (4mm) steel! The plan is: stretch to 4ga (5mm) then 
      maybe to 2ga (6mm) and put a flesh tunnel in. Keep watching this space!<BR CLEAR=ALL>

      once more in California so I had to visit Anne at Piercing Exquisite and 
      I got my daith repierced.<br>
      It's been very troublesome and as of early March 2000 it still hasn't healed.

      about the lobe piercing - the 9/16&quot; bead on my 00ga claw was pretty 
      much all the way through the lobe so it was time to move to a glass plug. 
      The actual plug is 7/16&quot; but the flanges are (obviously) wider. The 
      plug has a black background with an opal in it - you can't really see how 
      good it looks from the picture. I got it from Gottsi on Telegraph Ave in
