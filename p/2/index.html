    <p>About a month ago, I was <a href="http://corfield.org/blog/2018/12/19/atom-chlorine/">praising Chlorine, the new Clojure package for
Atom</a> and I've been using
it, day-in, day-out, for all my Clojure development. On a Mac, that's
straightforward because I start a Socket REPL on the Mac and I run Atom on the
Mac so when I connect via Chlorine and issue the <code>Chlorine: Load File</code>
command (via <code>Ctrl-, f</code> in my keymap), it sends <code>(load-file "/path/to/file.clj")</code>
to the REPL, for the file being edited, and that is evaluated and loads the
source from disk and compiles it. On Windows...<!-- more --> Well, on Windows
there are a few obstacles to this workflow.</p><p>The first obstacle (for me) is that <code>clj</code> doesn't run on Windows and that's
what I use for everything Clojure on a Mac and on Linux now. There's a
PowerShell implementation in progress but Windows has always been a bit of a
second-class citizen so it's still a ways off. But Windows has WSL (Windows
Subsystem for Linux) so I can
and do run (user-mode) Ubuntu on my Windows laptop and I do all of my Clojure
work on that...</p>

    <p>I've been using the <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> editor for about two years now.
I switched from Emacs after Clojure/conj 2016, having seen
<a href="https://youtu.be/buPPGxOnBnk">Jason Gilman's talk about ProtoREPL</a> [video].
It may sound like
heresy, but I'd never been happy with Emacs<!-- more --> -- not 17.x back when I first
started using it, not 18.x, not 19.x when I first stopped using it, nor 24.x onward
when I came back to it after learning Clojure a few decades later. I built
several configurations from scratch, I tried several "curated" configurations,
none of them felt like "home". Emacs just leeched too much of my development
time for my tastes. I wanted a simple, modern text editor, that offered a wide
variety of "plugins" and supported all the languages I used, with a sane set of
defaults. Atom -- with ProtoREPL -- seemed to be exactly what I was looking for!</p><p>And for two years, it has been my day-to-day development environment.</p>

    <p>Rich Hickey gave a very thought-provoking talk at Clojure/conj 2018
called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5WdGrpoug&amp;list=PLZdCLR02grLpMkEBXT22FTaJYxB92i3V3&amp;index=2">Maybe Not</a>, where he mused
on optionality and how we represent the absence of a value.<!-- more --></p><p>His talk covered many things, including how <code>clojure.spec/keys</code> currently
complects both structure and optionality (and his thoughts on fixing that
in a future version of <code>clojure.spec</code>), but his mention of <code>s/nilable</code> was what
triggered an "ah-ha!" moment for me.</p>

    <p>One of the more mysterious new features in Clojure 1.10 seems to be the pairing of <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/changes.md#26-datafy-and-nav"><code>datafy</code> and <code>nav</code></a> (and their underlying protocols, <code>Datafiable</code> and <code>Navigable</code>). Interest in these new functions has been piqued after Stuart Halloway showed off <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c52QhiXsmyI&amp;list=PLZdCLR02grLpMkEBXT22FTaJYxB92i3V3&amp;index=3">REBL at Clojure/conj</a> (video). Stu presented this functionality as "generalized laziness": <code>datafy</code> produces a "data representation" of things and <code>nav</code> lets you (lazily) navigate around that data.<!-- more --></p><p>The <a href="http://rebl.cognitect.com/">REBL</a> "is a graphical, interactive tool for browsing Clojure data". And in Clojure we're used to the concept of "it's just data" so a graphical browser might sound useful but not exactly earthshaking. But REBL is just an example of what can be built with the new functionality in 1.10 and, indeed, Stu's claim of "generalized laziness" is well made but a little hard to grok until you actually build something with the new protocols and functions.</p>

    <p>Sometimes you just can't help having a "random 3rd part JAR file" in your project. The best practice is, of course, to upload it to your preferred Maven-compatible repository via whatever service or software you use for all your in-house shared artifacts. But sometimes you just want to play with that JAR file locally, or you haven't gotten around to running your own shared repository.</p><p>If you're using Leiningen, you'll probably reach for the excellent <a href="https://github.com/kumarshantanu/lein-localrepo"><code>lein-localrepo</code></a> which lets you "install" your random JAR file into your local Maven cache (in <code>~/.m2/repository</code>).</p>

A while back, we had tried to update our New Relic Agent (used with our Tomcat-based web applications) from 3.21.0 to 3.25.0 and we ran into exceedingly long application start times, so we rolled back and continued on with 3.21.0. Recently, we decided to update the Agent to 3.30.1 to take advantage of advertised performance improvements and security enhancements. Once again we ran into exceedingly long application start times.</p><p>An application that took just over four minutes to start up fully with 3.21.0 was taking around forty minutes to start up with 3.30.1 -- an order of magnitude slower!<!-- more --></p>
