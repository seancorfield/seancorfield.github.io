    <p>I've often said that I try to follow <a href="https://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer">The Pragmatic Programmer's</a> advice to learn a new language every year. I don't always achieve it, but I try. As I've settled into Clojure as my primary language over the last several years, I've made a fair attempt to learn Python, Ruby, Racket/Scheme, Standard ML and more recently <a href="http://elm-lang.org">Elm</a>. I learned that I like Python, I don't like Ruby, Racket/Scheme is "just another Lisp" (I already have Clojure) and SML is very interesting but not really widely useful these days (it's a great language for learning Functional Programming concepts tho'!). I also spent some time with Go last year (don't like it).</p><p>The Elm language is really nice - and useful for building interactive browser-based applications (and games). I've been meaning to blog about it for quite a while, and I hope to get around to that in due course. Elm is sort of inspired by Haskell, and that's really what this blog post is about. Sort of.<!-- more --></p>

Alex Miller and his team have created an iconic event that crosses technology boundaries and bridges between academia and industry, to bring some of the brightest minds together to share their ideas. And for attendees too, the opportunity to meet a huge variety of our peers - from novice to expert - in all different technologies, creates an atmosphere of excitement, wonder, and enjoyment.</p>

    <p><em>This was originally posted on corfield.org back in April 2013 and I noticed it was recently referenced by Eric Normand in his recent blog post <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/convince-your-boss-to-use-clojure">Convince your boss to use Clojure</a> so I figured it was time to update the article and bring it onto my new blog.</em></p><p>A question was asked in early 2013 on a Clojure group on LinkedIn about reasons to migrate to Clojure for enterprise applications in a Java shop. It's a fairly typical question from people in the Java world when they hear the buzz about Clojure, and of course asking the question on a Clojure group garnered a lot of positive responses about why Clojure is a good choice. I didn't feel anyone had really addressed a core aspect of the original question which was, essentially, "Why should I, as a Java web developer, using JPA, JSF etc, choose Clojure instead for an enterprise application?".<!-- more --> The key considerations here are "enterprise application" and "Java web devloper, using JPA, JSF etc". Clojure is rightly praised for big data projects, simplified concurrency due to immutable data, and the conciseness of its solutions. The general advice when introducing Clojure to an organization is to take a grass roots approach: use it for some tooling first, or a small low-risk (but perhaps high-profile) project and show how well it works in a Java-dominated world. Then you get more and more developers trying it out and gradually the organization adopts it for more and more projects. It's good advice, and it's often how Clojure has crept into Java shops so far (as opposed to those fast-moving small shops that already have a tendency toward polyglot development).</p>

    <p>The first annual <a href="http://www.manning.com/poweredbyjavascript/">Powered by JavaScript</a> conference, organized by <a href="http://www.manning.com/">Manning Books</a>, took place in St Louis this past week. How did this inaugural event work for someone like me who really doesn't JavaScript?<!-- more --></p><p>I'm fairly public about my dislike of JavaScript - and it's an easy language to take pot shots at. Indeed, in the following two days of <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/">The Strange Loop</a> conference, several speakers reminded us why JavaScript's flaws have led to so much innovation in both the compile-to-JS ("altJS") and the native JS framework space. Despite the (many) flaws, JS is ubiquitous and has evolved from a hastily constructed scripting engine to become the powerhouse of the modern web and with Node.js has moved into the server side development space and as a common part of a build chain that touches almost every web development shop, regardless of their core technology.</p>

    <p><em>Adapted from a post I made on my old blog in January, 2014, about the first few workshops being planned.</em></p><p>I've been an advocate of diversity in IT for a long time. I'm very pleased to work in a company that has an above average ratio of female to male employees, as well as very diverse cultural backgrounds amongst our staff. In most tech communities, diversity is pretty low. It's why organizations like <a href="http://railsbridge.org/">RailsBridge</a> and <a href="http://womenwhocode.com/">Women Who Code</a> and numerous others exist. The lack of diversity hurts us all because a homogeneous community doesn't have diversity of thought either: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=diverse+teams+outperform">diverse teams outperform homogeneous teams</a>.<!-- more --></p>

    <p>Sometimes it's very enlightening to look back at the beginning of a project to see how things got set up and how we started down the path that led to where we are today. In this post, I'm going to talk about the first ten tickets we created at World Singles as we kicked off our green field rewrite project five years ago.<!-- more --></p><p>I've been involved with World Singles for about five years now, about three and a half years as a full-time engineer. The project was a green field rewrite of a dating system the company had evolved over about a decade that, back in 2009, was running on ColdFusion 8 on Windows, and using SQL Server. The new platform soft-launched in late 2011 as we migrated a few small sites across and our full launch - migrating millions of members in the process - was May 2012. At that point we switched from "build" mode to "operations" mode, and today we maintain a large codebase that is a combination of CFML and Clojure, running on Railo 4.2 on Linux, and using MySQL and MongoDB, running partly in our East Coast data center and partly on Amazon.</p>

    <p>This was my second time at <a href="http://thestrangeloop.com">The Strange Loop</a>. When I attended in 2011, I said that it was one of the best conferences I had ever attended, and I was disappointed that family plans meant I couldn't attend in 2012. That meant my expectations were high. The main hotel for the event was the beautiful DoubleTree Union Station, an historic castle-like building that was once an ornate train station. The conference itself was a short walk away at the Peabody Opera House. Alex Miller, organizer of The Strange Loop, <a href="http://clojurewest.com">Clojure/West</a>, and <a href="http://lambdajam.com">Lambda Jam</a> (new this year), likes to use interesting venues, to make the conferences extra special.</p><p>I'm providing a brief summary here of what sessions I attended, followed by some general commentary about the event. As I said last time, if you can only attend one conference a year, this should be the one.</p>

    <p>We've recently started evaluating the <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic monitoring service</a> at World Singles and when you use their Java agent with your web application container, you can get a lot of information about what's going on inside your application (JVM activity, database activity, external HTTP calls, web transaction traces).<!-- more --> For a CFML application tho', all you tend to get in the web transaction traces is the Servlet entry point, some JDBC SQL reports, and some of the low-level Java libraries (if you're lucky!).</p><p>However, we have a mixture of CFML and Clojure, running on the <a href="http://www.getrailo.org">free open source Railo server</a> so I thought it might be possible to somehow instrument the Clojure code to enable more visibility into our application traces.</p>
