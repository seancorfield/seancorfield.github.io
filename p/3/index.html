    <p>Today I'm inspired by the <a href="http://us4.campaign-archive1.com/?u=a33b5228d1b5bf2e0c68a83f4&amp;id=56d35f53c5">latest issue of Eric Normand's Clojure Gazette</a> which talks about why his "Joy of Programming" comes from learning and exploration.</p><p>I got into programming as a child because I was curious about solving puzzles and problems: given the (relatively) limited vocabulary of a programming language and its input and output features, and some interesting problem that came to mind, can I solve it in a usable (and hopefully elegant) way?</p>

    <p>Back in February I talked about <a href="http://corfield.org/blog/2016/02/02/boot-new/">boot-new</a> and talked about a "future 1.0.0 release". We're not there yet, but <a href="https://github.com/seancorfield/boot-new#boot-generators">generators</a> got added in release 0.4.0 and, in the four minor releases since, the focus has been on refactoring to match the core <a href="http://boot-clj.com/">Boot</a> task structure and improving compatibility with Leiningen templates. At World Singles, we've continued to extend our usage of Boot until we have only a couple of Ant tasks left and we expect those to be within Boot's reach soon. In this post, I want to cover some of the things we've been doing with Boot recently.<!-- more --></p><p>I feel I should start with an apology for the "radio silence" since February -- it's a combination of work being extremely engaging (and busy!) and some aspects of my personal life going somewhat to hell in a handbasket... But things have improved lately (thankfully!) and I hope to be more regular in my blogging (I certainly have a decent queue of article ideas in my head!).</p>

Once I had <a href="https://github.com/seancorfield/boot-expectations">boot-expectations</a> written, I was casting around for other missing pieces in the ecosystem and one glaring one was the lack of something to generate new projects from templates.<!-- more --></p><p>Leiningen has long-supported the generation of new projects from templates and it's pretty slick.

    <p>In <a href="http://corfield.org/blog/2016/01/30/building-on-boot/">Building On Boot</a>, I gave some high level benefits we'd found with Boot, compared to Leiningen, and how it had helped up streamline our build process. That article closed with a note about Boot not having the equivalent of common Leiningen plugins, and that's what I'm going to cover here, since that was the first real obstacle we encountered.<!-- more --></p><p>We use <a href="http://jayfields.com/expectations/">Jay Fields' Expectations</a> library very heavily for most of our testing needs. We use <code>clojure.test</code> only for our <a href="https://github.com/semperos/clj-webdriver">Clojure-powered WebDriver testing</a>. Leiningen has a <code>test</code> task built-in and we had been using <a href="https://github.com/gar3thjon3s/lein-expectations">lein-expectations</a> for years. It was quite a shock to find out that Boot has no testing tasks built-in!</p>

    <p>I've often said that I try to follow <a href="https://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer">The Pragmatic Programmer's</a> advice to learn a new language every year. I don't always achieve it, but I try. As I've settled into Clojure as my primary language over the last several years, I've made a fair attempt to learn Python, Ruby, Racket/Scheme, Standard ML and more recently <a href="http://elm-lang.org">Elm</a>. I learned that I like Python, I don't like Ruby, Racket/Scheme is "just another Lisp" (I already have Clojure) and SML is very interesting but not really widely useful these days (it's a great language for learning Functional Programming concepts tho'!). I also spent some time with Go last year (don't like it).</p><p>The Elm language is really nice - and useful for building interactive browser-based applications (and games). I've been meaning to blog about it for quite a while, and I hope to get around to that in due course. Elm is sort of inspired by Haskell, and that's really what this blog post is about. Sort of.<!-- more --></p>

Alex Miller and his team have created an iconic event that crosses technology boundaries and bridges between academia and industry, to bring some of the brightest minds together to share their ideas. And for attendees too, the opportunity to meet a huge variety of our peers - from novice to expert - in all different technologies, creates an atmosphere of excitement, wonder, and enjoyment.</p>

    <p><em>This was originally posted on corfield.org back in April 2013 and I noticed it was recently referenced by Eric Normand in his recent blog post <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/convince-your-boss-to-use-clojure">Convince your boss to use Clojure</a> so I figured it was time to update the article and bring it onto my new blog.</em></p><p>A question was asked in early 2013 on a Clojure group on LinkedIn about reasons to migrate to Clojure for enterprise applications in a Java shop. It's a fairly typical question from people in the Java world when they hear the buzz about Clojure, and of course asking the question on a Clojure group garnered a lot of positive responses about why Clojure is a good choice. I didn't feel anyone had really addressed a core aspect of the original question which was, essentially, "Why should I, as a Java web developer, using JPA, JSF etc, choose Clojure instead for an enterprise application?".<!-- more --> The key considerations here are "enterprise application" and "Java web devloper, using JPA, JSF etc". Clojure is rightly praised for big data projects, simplified concurrency due to immutable data, and the conciseness of its solutions. The general advice when introducing Clojure to an organization is to take a grass roots approach: use it for some tooling first, or a small low-risk (but perhaps high-profile) project and show how well it works in a Java-dominated world. Then you get more and more developers trying it out and gradually the organization adopts it for more and more projects. It's good advice, and it's often how Clojure has crept into Java shops so far (as opposed to those fast-moving small shops that already have a tendency toward polyglot development).</p>
