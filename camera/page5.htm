                  150mm lenses were launched. They were direct-vision, non
                  optical types, and consisted of a cylinder with a three
                  sixteenths of an inch hole at one end to form the eyepiece,

          depended upon the length of the cylinder. They were finished to match

          viewfinder was £2.1s.8d.&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left">A lens hood and filter holder was produced to fit
          onto Lumar lenses. It was turned and polished to match the lens, and
          was a press fit over the inner ring of the lens
          mount. The filter holder screwed apart to accept standard 31mm filters. The
          price was £1.6s.3d.</p>
          <p align="left">Another new product was a set of four well made
          extension tubes, each with a Leica thread. They were made of metal and
          finished in black. The sizes were 52mm, 34mm, 26mm, and 18mm. They
          gave reductions of 1:1, 2:3, 1:2, and 1:3 respectively. The price of
          the set was £2.17s.8d. There was also a separate 10mm tube available
          for a 1:4 reduction, priced at 8s.11d.</p>

                  to use in
                  combination with the extension tubes for close-up work. It
                  consisted of a housing carrying a ground glass screen and a
                  lens flange. Their separation distance was the same as the
                  film to flange distance in the Periflex camera. In use the
                  adapter was screwed into a tripod with the lens fitted to it.
                  The lens was focused and the adapter was replaced by the
                  camera, care being taken, of course, not to disturb the focus
                  setting or the tripod. It sold for £2.17s.8d.</td>

          <p align="left">The best selling Corfield product was the Periflex
          camera. Its main competition was from Germany, but by 1956 German
          camera prices were falling and so it was essential to redesign the
          Periflex to ensure it retained its appeal.&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left">In the new model, consideration was given to making the
          camera easier to use, and John designed an automated periscope mechanism. The
          periscope was automatically lowered each time the film was advanced,
          and raised before the shutter fired. This greatly increased the
          complexity of the mechanism, and meant that the camera had to be taller
          to accommodate the extra mechanics. The taller body also meant that an
          internal viewfinder could now be used. The new periscope was
          completely housed inside the camera body, which had an extra eye-level
          eyepiece on the back next to the one for the viewfinder.
          Interchangeable objectives could be screwed onto the front of the
          viewfinder to cater for lenses of different focal lengths.</p>
          <p align="left">The top and bottom plates were given a finer, more
          durable finish, and the film wind and shutter speed controls were
          neater and easier to handle. Winding the shutter and transporting the
          film were now a simultaneous function of the film wind-on control,
          which also positioned the periscope. All of this was done in just half
          a turn, making for a very rapid action. The film speed dial was built
          around the rewind knob at the left end of the top plate. The film
          speed as set by the dial could be viewed in a third eyepiece that was
          just to the right of the other two. The rewind knob pulled-up to
          rewind the film. X and M flash synchronisation sockets were
          mounted on the front panel next to the viewfinder.&nbsp;</p>

                  was so well known, and also to produce two versions, one
                  cheaper than the other. The cheaper version was to be called
                  the Periflex 2, and the more expensive version was to be the
                  Periflex 3. It was also decided, that it would be better to
                  regulate the rate of sales by releasing the more expensive
                  version first. Otherwise the initial demand for the cheaper
                  version alone could be too great for the company to handle.</td>

          Lanthanum glass elements were made by Enna Werk in Germany to a very
          high standard. One interesting feature is a very wide focus adjustment
          which allows the lens to focus down to 12 inches, making this a very
          early macro lens. Other Corfield lenses available for the camera at
          this time were the 45mm f1.9 and the 35mm f3.5 Lumaxes, the 50mm f3.5
          Lumar-X, and the 100mm f4 Lumar.</p>

                  duration of about 1/500 sec. The power output was 35 joules. A
                  set of batteries was quite expensive at 26 shillings, but this
                  would give a guaranteed 800 flashes. The flash weighed-in at
