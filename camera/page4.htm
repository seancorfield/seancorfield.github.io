          <font size="4">The Family Business</font></font></strong></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">K. G. Corfield Ltd was
          in every sense a family business. Sir Kenneth, Betty, and brother
          John were soon joined by their other brother Stan, who looked after
          production. They were also joined by their father, Mr. Stanley Corfield,
          who came out of retirement to become the credit controller. They
          looked after their employees extremely well; everyone was treated as
          an individual. This led to a well-motivated and enthusiastic team,
          many of whom felt like family members. They were given every
          opportunity and assistance to improve their skills, as skilled labour
          was always in short supply.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">In 1954 the Maharajah
          of Mysore placed a large order for Periflex cameras. This was featured
          in the October 22nd edition of the Wolverhampton Chronicle under the
          heading &quot;Corfield Bulletin&quot;. A whole page was devoted to the
          history of the company, and several of the employees were
          interviewed.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">Hans Lehmann, who by
          now had joined the company, was in
          charge of the camera assembly room, and told how he had not thought that he
          would be able to get back into the trade after the war. He had
          originally learned how to make optical instruments such as
          rangefinders, but the war intervened. During the war he was a
          Luftwaffe pilot and then a prisoner of war in the United States. He
          had since worked on a farm and been a machine operator.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">Mr. John Roberts did
          all of the company's advertising, designing and printing. He had been a
          pupil at the Wolverhampton Art College where he excelled in commercial
          design. His full page adverts appeared fortnightly in the Amateur
          Photographer. He described the design process as follows: &quot;Basic
          thing is to get down, even roughly, the important article for the
          leaflet. The design, the ornamentation will come afterwards&quot;.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">Walsall born Gerald
          Whitton was the company's toolmaker. Like Sir Kenneth he used to work
          for Fischer Bearings. He founded the machine shop and developed all of
          the company's machine tools. He described how it was vital to have the
          correct tools for each of the 175 parts in the camera.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">The firm's two original
          employees were also interviewed. Mrs. Florence Abbiss who was the
          firm's packer described how she daily sent parcels of cameras off to
          Hong Kong. She was responsible for all of the parcels, packages and
          crates that left Corfields for the home market and abroad. Mr. Reg
          Simmons, a skilled mechanic, was in charge of production in the
          assembly shop. He described his job as seeing that the girls correctly
          assembled the various components, and how he personally carried out any
          repairs to equipment that was returned from dealers.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">Sir Kenneth mentioned
          that his wish was to make photography more universal and help this
          country become what is known as a photographic nation, like Germany or
          the United States. He wanted his camera to be used by amateurs as well
          as professionals and would like to make the business grow. He summed
          up his hopes as follows: &quot;At its present rate of growth we should
          become one of the leading firms in the country during the next ten
          years. Demand for our products is terrific. We have a staff who
          believe and share our enthusiasm in the future of the firm&quot;.</font></p>
