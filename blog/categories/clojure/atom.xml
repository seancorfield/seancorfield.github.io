    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you just can&rsquo;t help having a &ldquo;random 3rd part JAR file&rdquo; in your project. The best practice is, of course, to upload it to your preferred Maven-compatible repository via whatever service or software you use for all your in-house shared artifacts. But sometimes you just want to play with that JAR file locally, or you haven&rsquo;t gotten around to running your own shared repository.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re using Leiningen, you&rsquo;ll probably reach for the excellent <a href="https://github.com/kumarshantanu/lein-localrepo"><code>lein-localrepo</code></a> which lets you &ldquo;install&rdquo; your random JAR file into your local Maven cache (in <code>~/.m2/repository</code>).</p>

<p>What do you do if you&rsquo;re using Boot instead?<!-- more --></p>

<p>Well, you <em>could</em> just keep <code>lein</code> installed and use it for this (with the <code>lein-localrepo</code> plugin dependency in your <code>~/.lein/profiles.clj</code>, for example):</p>

<pre><code class="bash">lein localrepo install foobar.jar foo/bar 1.0.1
</code></pre>

<p>Or you could run some command line Boot to make that happen:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">boot pom -p foo/bar -v 1.0.1 target \
    install -f foobar.jar -p target/META-INF/maven/foo/bar/pom.xml
# Don't forget to clean up!
rm -rf target
</code></pre>

<p>What the what? Yeah, that&rsquo;s really kind of ugly. Unfortunately, the <code>install</code> task seems to expect a physical <code>pom.xml</code> file when you specify a physical JAR file. That means we need to drop a <code>target</code> task into the pipeline into order for the generated <code>pom.xml</code> to be written to disk. It would be nice if it would look in the fileset first, because then at least this should work:</p>

<pre><code class="bash"># This does NOT work!
boot pom -p foo/bar -v 1.0.1 install -f foobar.jar -p foo/bar
</code></pre>

<p>So what other options do we have with Boot?</p>

<p>Well, it turns out that you can run some Leiningen plugins directly from Boot, from the command line! Boot lets you specify dependencies on the command line, and it lets you &ldquo;call&rdquo; Clojure code from the command line too. Let&rsquo;s start a REPL with <code>lein-localrepo</code> as a dependency:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">boot -d leiningen -d lein-localrepo repl
</code></pre>

<p>We need Leiningen as well since plugins rely on it as a dependency. Now, in the REPL we can require the main namespace from the plugin, and get information about the entry point:</p>

<pre><code class="clojure">boot.user=&gt; (require '[leiningen.localrepo :as lr])
nil
boot.user=&gt; (doc lr/localrepo)
-------------------------
leiningen.localrepo/localrepo
([_] [_ command &amp; args])
  Work with local Maven repository

Usage: lein localrepo &lt;command&gt; (commands are listed below)
...
</code></pre>

<p>For any given plugin, <code>lein-foo</code>, the entry point is <code>leiningen.foo/foo</code>. Note that it is called with an unused argument and then the actual command line arguments. So we can ask for help on the <code>install</code> command:</p>

<pre><code class="clojure">boot.user=&gt; (lr/localrepo nil "help" "install")
Install artifact to local repository
  Arguments:
    [options] &lt;filename&gt; &lt;artifact-id&gt; &lt;version&gt;
  Options:
...
</code></pre>

<p>So we can call that function to perform the JAR install we want:</p>

<pre><code class="clojure">boot.user=&gt; (lr/localrepo nil "install" "foobar.jar" "foo/bar" "1.0.1")

&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a bit disappointing &ndash; we exited the REPL and got our command prompt back. I guess that calls <code>(System/exit)</code> which is a bit unfriendly (but, perhaps, not unexpected given the use case for this plugin). But we can verify that the JAR file was installed:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">&gt; ls -R ~/.m2/repository/foo
bar

/Users/sean/.m2/repository/foo/bar:
1.0.1               maven-metadata-local.xml

/Users/sean/.m2/repository/foo/bar/1.0.1:
_remote.repositories    bar-1.0.1.jar       bar-1.0.1.pom
</code></pre>

<p>Now, remember that I said you can &ldquo;call&rdquo; code from the command line with Boot? Since we know the code we need to execute (the <code>require</code> and the call to <code>lr/localrepo</code>), we&rsquo;ll just supply those as command line arguments to the <code>call</code> task:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">boot -d leiningen -d lein-localrepo \
  call -e "(require '[leiningen.localrepo :as lr])" \
       -e '(lr/localrepo nil "install" "foobar.jar" "foo/bar" "1.0.1")'
</code></pre>

<p>Voila!</p>

<p><em>Updated November 22nd, 2017: I published a boot-localrepo task!</em></p>

<p>And if you don&rsquo;t want to type all that, you can now do:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">boot -d seancorfield/boot-localrepo install-artifact -f foobar.jar -P foo/bar -v 1.0.1
</code></pre>

    <link href="http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2017/07/17/clojure-java-jdbc-0-7-0/"/>
    <updated>2017-07-17T03:40:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2017/07/17/clojure-java-jdbc-0-7-0</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The stable 0.7.0 release of <code>java.jdbc</code> &ndash; the <a href="https://github.com/clojure/java.jdbc">Clojure Contrib JDBC library</a> &ndash; has been baking for over a year, across of a trail of alpha and beta releases, and is now, finally, available!</p>

<p>While you <em>could</em> read the <a href="https://github.com/clojure/java.jdbc/blob/master/CHANGES.md"><code>java.jdbc</code> Change Log</a> to figure out what is new in this release, I thought it would be easier to consolidate all the changes into a blog post, with changes organized by category, and provide justification for the various changes.<!-- more --></p>

<p>I recently ran a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-CJY2YMHP/">survey about versions</a> of both Clojure and <code>java.jdbc</code> in use and had nearly 100 responses (thank you to everyone who completed the survey!). Only one respondent is still on Clojure 1.7.0, with about two thirds on 1.8.0, and a full third of respondents on a 1.9.0 alpha build. No one responded that they&rsquo;re on an earlier version of Clojure. That&rsquo;s great news for Clojure library maintainers, as it means we can take advantage of modern features in the language (such as transducers), and it also means that it is worthwhile to offer optional namespaces providing specs. <strong>Accordingly, <code>java.jdbc</code> now requires Clojure 1.7.0 or later.</strong></p>

<p>Also very encouraging was to see that almost a third of <code>java.jdbc</code> users are on alpha builds of what has become 0.7.0, with only a handful of users still on &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; versions (prior to 0.6.1).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the major changes in 0.7.0, compared to 0.6.1!</p>

<h2>Reducible Queries</h2>

<p>Now that Clojure 1.7.0 is the minimum supported version, <code>java.jdbc</code> can offer query result collections that work with transducers. Two new functions &ndash; <code>reducible-query</code> and <code>reducible-result-set</code> &ndash; produce collections that implement <code>IReduce</code> and will perform resource management when <code>reduce</code>d. A reducible query will run the specified query only when the result is reduced &ndash; and it will run it each time it is reduced. A reducible result set can be constructed from any <code>ResultSet</code> object and will provide a one-off, managed forward read of the underlying data. Both of these support <code>reduced</code> results, which short-circuit the processing of the result set. They also support both the <code>init</code>-arity <code>reduce</code> and the no-<code>init</code>-arity <code>reduce</code>. Consult the docstring for <code>reduce</code> to see the full implications of this: the function passed into the no-<code>init</code>-arity <code>reduce</code> will be called with no arguments if the result set is empty!</p>

<p><code>reducible-query</code> works by invoking <code>db-query-with-resultset</code> only when it is <code>reduce</code>d, passing in a function that calls <code>reducible-result-set</code> and then <code>reduce</code>s the result. <code>reducible-result-set</code> works by computing metadata and key names only when it is <code>reduce</code>d, and then walking through the rows of the result, calling the supplied function (as specified by <code>reduce</code>), stopping if that function returns a <code>reduced?</code> value.</p>

<h2>Improved Database Vendor Support</h2>

<p>The <code>:dbtype</code> key in a <code>db-spec</code> is the preferred way to specify a database vendor, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about &ldquo;subprotocols&rdquo; and &ldquo;subnames&rdquo; and so on. Just provide <code>:dbtype</code>, <code>:dbname</code>, <code>:host</code>, <code>:port</code>, <code>:user</code>, and <code>:password</code>, and <code>java.jdbc</code> should be able to connect you to most databases. The full list of supported <code>:dbtype</code> values is:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>derby</code> &ndash; Apache Derby</li>
<li><code>h2</code></li>
<li><code>hsql</code> or <code>hsqldb</code></li>
<li><code>jtds</code> or <code>jtds:sqlserver</code> &ndash; the jTDS JDBC driver for Microsoft SQL Server</li>
<li><code>mssql</code> &ndash; an alias for <code>sqlserver</code> below</li>
<li><code>mysql</code></li>
<li><code>oracle</code> or <code>oracle:thin</code>, <code>oracle:oci</code> &ndash; for the two main Oracle JDBC drivers (which use <code>@</code> in front of the <code>host</code> name, instead of <code>//</code>)</li>
<li><code>pgsql</code> &ndash; the Impossibl PostgresSQL JDBC driver</li>
<li><code>postgres</code> or <code>postgresl</code> &ndash; the standard PostgresSQL JDBC driver</li>
<li><code>redshift</code> &ndash; Amazon&rsquo;s Red Shift JDBC driver</li>
<li><code>sqlite</code></li>
<li><code>sqlserver</code> &ndash; Microsoft&rsquo;s default JDBC driver for SQL Server (they have finally released a version on Maven Central!)</li>
</ul>


<p>If your preferred database is not listed, head on over to <a href="https://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/JDBC"><code>java.jdbc</code>s JIRA site</a> and create an enhancement issue, with details of the JDBC driver and I&rsquo;ll take a look! Note that you can can specify <code>:classname</code>, along with <code>:dbtype</code> if you want to override just the JDBC driver class name that <code>java.jdbc</code> would deduce from <code>:dbtype</code>.</p>

<h2>Option Handling</h2>

<p>An overall goal of 0.7.0 has been to make the API more consistent, especially in the way options are handled and passed around. The intention is that you can provide a hash map of options, as the last argument to any function, and <code>java.jdbc</code> will pass all of those options through the whole call chain, allowing you to control a lot more of the behavior of lower-level functions that are invoked by the higher-level functions. In addition, defaults for all options can be provided in your <code>db-spec</code>, and those will apply to all API functions. This is especially useful for specifying the <code>:entities</code> and <code>:identifiers</code> functions that control how SQL entity names and Clojure identifiers are constructed, everywhere in <code>java.jdbc</code>.</p>

<p>Here are all the new options available:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>:auto-commit?</code> &ndash; Can be passed into any API function that might cause a new database connection to be created. This allows you to turn auto-commit off for <em>new connections</em> in databases that use this setting to control whether a query can stream its results. The behavior is inherently vendor-specific, so you may need additional options to fully enable streaming results (setting <code>:fetch-size</code> to a non-zero value is common).</li>
<li><code>:conditional?</code> &ndash; For the two DDL-generating functions to add an existence check on the table to be created or dropped. May be a simple boolean value, a string (to be inserted between <code>DROP TABLE</code>/<code>CREATE TABLE</code> and the table name), or a function. In the latter case, the DDL string is generated as usual and then that function is called on it. This allows for databases that don&rsquo;t support <code>DROP TABLE IF EXISTS</code> / <code>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS</code> but instead require the <code>DROP</code> or <code>CREATE</code> statement to be wrapped in a specific existence checking query.</li>
<li><code>:explain?</code> and <code>:explain-fn</code> &ndash; So you can get the database to explain how it will run your query. Supported by <code>query</code>, <code>find-by-keys</code>, and <code>get-by-id</code>, these options will run the generated SQL with an &ldquo;explain&rdquo; option first, and then for real. <code>:explain?</code> can be <code>true</code> which simply prefixes the SQL with <code>"EXPLAIN "</code> or it can be a string if your database needs a different syntax (such as HSQLDB needing <code>"EXPLAIN PLAN FOR "</code>). The explanation output is processed by the <code>:explain-fn</code>, which defaults to <code>println</code>, but can be used to send explanations to a logging system etc.</li>
<li><code>:qualifier</code> &ndash; Lets you easily produce namespace-qualified column names from your queries.</li>
<li><code>:read-columns</code> &ndash; To specify how columns of data are read from a <code>ResultSet</code> object. The default behavior is to call <code>result-set-read-column</code> which implements the <code>IResultSetReadColumn</code> protocol. This allows finer-grained control when you are working with multiple databases in a single application.</li>
<li><code>:read-only?</code> &ndash; Like <code>:auto-commit?</code> this can be passed into any API function that might cause a new database connection to be created. This allows you to specify that <em>new connections</em> be treated as readonly, which may allow the database driver to perform optimizations on how the connection and its queries behave.</li>
</ul>


<h2>clojure.spec</h2>

<p><code>java.jdbc</code> provides an optional <code>clojure.java.jdbc.spec</code> namespace that is compatible with Clojure 1.9.0 Alpha 17 (it uses <code>clojure.spec.alpha</code>). This namespace provides <code>fdef</code> specs for all of the public functions in <code>clojure.java.jdbc</code> so you can <code>instrument</code> your code and get validation on all your interaction with <code>java.jdbc</code>. Note that you cannot do generative testing against <code>java.jdbc</code> because it uses a lot of Java types and a lot of side effects. <em>I have an experimental branch where I&rsquo;ve been investigating what generators would look like for <code>java.jdbc</code> but don&rsquo;t hold your breath for that becoming part of the <strong>master</strong> branch!</em></p>

<h2>New and Changed API Functions</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>as-sql-name</code> dropped its single arity (curried) version.</li>
<li><code>get-isolation-level</code> will return the current isolation level inside a transaction, if any.</li>
<li><code>quoted</code> dropped its 2-arity version, and now supports certain keywords for common entity-quoting strategies: <code>:ansi</code> (wraps entities in double quotes), <code>:mysql</code> (wraps entities in backticks), <code>:oracle</code> (wraps entities in double quotes), and <code>:sqlserver</code> (wraps entities in square brackets). These match the options in HoneySQL.</li>
<li><code>reducible-query</code> and <code>reducible-result-set</code> &ndash; see <strong>Reducible Queries</strong> above.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>At present, the auto-generated API documentation (on <a href="https://clojure.github.io">https://clojure.github.io</a>) is stale due to some bugs in the toolchain used by the Clojure Build Server, so I recommend reading the <a href="http://clojure-doc.org/articles/ecosystem/java_jdbc/home.html">community-maintained <code>java.jdbc</code> documentation</a> on clojure-doc.org, in addition to using <code>clojure.repl/doc</code> to review the docstrings for API functions. That community-maintained documentation is currently going through a major overhaul to expand, clarify, and update the information presented &ndash; I encourage users of <code>java.jdbc</code> to get involved by submitting Pull Requests to help improve the documentation for everyone!</p>

    <link href="http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2016/07/29/clojure-new-relic-slow-startup/"/>
    <updated>2016-07-29T13:20:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2016/07/29/clojure-new-relic-slow-startup</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of years ago, I blogged about <a href="http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2013/05/01/instrumenting-clojure-for-new-relic-monitoring/">instrumenting Clojure for New Relic monitoring</a> and we&rsquo;ve generally been pretty happy with New Relic as a service overall. A while back, we had tried to update our New Relic Agent (used with our Tomcat-based web applications) from 3.21.0 to 3.25.0 and we ran into exceedingly long application start times, so we rolled back and continued on with 3.21.0. Recently, we decided to update the Agent to 3.30.1 to take advantage of advertised performance improvements and security enhancements. Once again we ran into exceedingly long application start times.</p>

<p>An application that took just over four minutes to start up fully with 3.21.0 was taking around forty minutes to start up with 3.30.1 &ndash; an order of magnitude slower!<!-- more --></p>

<p>Since we really wanted this update, we contacted New Relic Technical Support. Somewhat cryptically, they asked us to try version 3.24.1 &ndash; and that did not exhibit the slow startup &ndash; at which point they acknowledged that they&rsquo;d had reports that, with some applications, some customers had experienced slow startups since the 3.25.0 release. They asked us to set the logging level to &ldquo;finest&rdquo;, start the application up on a test machine, and then send them the log file. It was over 230MB(!) and full of Weave violations that the &ldquo;original bytecode&rdquo; could not be found. They very quickly traced this to how their instrumentation code tries to decide which classes to trace and which to ignore &ndash; and noted that Clojure creates a lot of <code>clojure.lang.DynamicClassLoader</code> instances (about 176,000 warnings in the log files originated from this class!) and, since the instrumentation never finds anything useful to instrument, loaded via those classloaders, they suggested that we tell the Agent to skip them.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, this is not a documented configuration item (although there is a similar <code>classloader_excludes</code> list):
<code>
  class_transformer:
    classloader_blacklist: clojure.lang.DynamicClassLoader
</code>
This stops the Agent from examining this classloader and/or the code loaded by it and it dramatically cut the application start times. After adding this to <code>newrelic.yml</code>, our applications started up slightly faster than they had with 3.21.0.</p>

<p>So, thank you to Jesse @ New Relic for the swift troubleshooting on this issue! I&rsquo;m posting this because I couldn&rsquo;t find a solution to the problem via Google &ndash; although I could find people complaining about the problem. Hopefully this will help others using New Relic with Clojure (or other languages that hit the same issue).</p>

    <link href="http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2016/07/18/start-your-engine/"/>
    <updated>2016-07-18T04:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://seancorfield.github.io/blog/2016/07/18/start-your-engine</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I&rsquo;m inspired by the <a href="http://us4.campaign-archive1.com/?u=a33b5228d1b5bf2e0c68a83f4&amp;id=56d35f53c5">latest issue of Eric Normand&rsquo;s Clojure Gazette</a> which talks about why his &ldquo;Joy of Programming&rdquo; comes from learning and exploration.</p>

<p>I got into programming as a child because I was curious about solving puzzles and problems: given the (relatively) limited vocabulary of a programming language and its input and output features, and some interesting problem that came to mind, can I solve it in a usable (and hopefully elegant) way?</p>

<p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve written a <strong>lot</strong> of fun little programs to solve all sorts of interesting puzzles and problems that I&rsquo;ve either run across or invented just to amuse myself. I learn different programming languages to learn new vocabularies for solving problems, and new ways of looking at problems.</p>

<p>Some of those programs become libraries that I&rsquo;ve ended up using at work in one form or another, some become open source projects where I&rsquo;m pretty much the only user, a very small number become widely used projects.<!-- more --></p>

<p>Back in 2009, when my work was primarily CFML-based (and I wrote side projects in other languages for fun), I sketched out, figuratively on a <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2010/02/06/fw1-the-napkin-spec/">napkin, my ideas for a minimal MVC framework, based on conventions</a>. It was intended as an exercise to &ldquo;scratch an itch&rdquo;. It went on to become one of the most popular MVC frameworks in the CFML community (and I still maintain it to this day, even tho' my work is almost entirely Clojure now).</p>

<p>Again, as an exercise to &ldquo;scratch an itch&rdquo;, while I was still relatively new to Clojure, I decided to <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2011/11/07/fw1-comes-to-clojure/">port the core of that framework to Clojure</a>. It started as a bundle of <a href="https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring">Ring</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cgrand/enlive">Enlive</a>, and a convention-based routes-to-namespace-and-function mapping. Along the way, I replaced Enlive with <a href="https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer">Selmer</a>, and this &ldquo;fun little program&rdquo; now falls into the category of an open source project where I&rsquo;m pretty much the only user (we&rsquo;re starting to use it at work).</p>

<p>About a year ago, I had another puzzle in mind: could I create a usable library that allowed for a separation of queryable data sources, pure business logic, and committable changes (inserts, updates, and deletes). I created <a href="https://github.com/seancorfield/engine">Engine</a> purely to scratch that itch over a few days at the end of May 2015 and, apart from converting it to use Boot at the end of 2015, it&rsquo;s languished on GitHub ever since. Until a few weeks ago, when it looked like a solution to a problem at work.</p>

<p>We wanted a clearly delineated idiom where we could refactor our business logic out into pure functions, that depended on a set of queryable resources (some readonly JDBC and MongoDB data sources, a Component-based &ldquo;system&rdquo;, etc), and produce a set of changes that could be applied to a database or sent over a message queue to be processed or to update a search engine etc. We wanted something that &ldquo;forced&rdquo; this on our code (or at least &ldquo;strongly encouraged&rdquo; this separation of concerns).</p>

<p>Using Engine in the real world has caused it to grow and evolve to make it more fluent in production code (hence the flurry of changes and new releases over the last few weeks) but it&rsquo;s also allowed us to take a long, hard look at what shape our code needs to be, in order to support our legacy production platform, our new production platform, and our future production platform.</p>

<p>Although it would be nice to get extra eyes on both Engine and FW/1 for Clojure and, yes, additional users of both projects, I&rsquo;m posting this mostly as encouragement to &ldquo;scratch your itch&rdquo; and to write code as a way of learning, and exploring new ideas. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if that code is ultimately useful to anyone other than to you, as a medium for expressing your thoughts: write it down, play with it, use it to investigate a new concept or to rethink an existing one. Above all, <strong>enjoy</strong> programming!</p>
