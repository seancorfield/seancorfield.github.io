<font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src=septum.jpg align=left> This is a lot of fun! 
I get more comments about this than any other piercing I've had so far. "Did it 
hurt?" No, except when Warwick accidentally caught the needle on the inside of 
my right nostril. I wear it at work a fair bit and everyone has got used to it 
now but it really does have the best shock value of all my piercings. I have quite 
a range of jewellery for it too: a retainer bought in Dallas, a beautiful ring 
given me by Anne "Ardvark" Greenblatt which has a flat 'side' and a black haematite 
bead, a ram's skull bead ring and the standard CBR you see here. </font>
