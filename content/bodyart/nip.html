<title>Double Nipple Piercing</title>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src=nip.jpg align=left> The horizontal piercing 
was done at 10ga by Patrick of the London Piercing Clinic and the vertical was 
done at 14ga by Cushla of Into You. The horizontal piercing was the only piercing 
I've had done under anaesthetic and it healed completely in under two months. 
The vertical piercing was done about 6 months ago without anaesthetic and has 
been been reasonably trouble free but has definitely taken longer to heal. The 
ring was originally at the base of the nipple but I seem to get a lot of migration 
as you can see - although the bar hasn't moved much at all.</font> 
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"> In case you're wondering, it's the ring that's 
  crooked - it was perfectly level when it was done but has migrated both forwards 
  and to an angle. </font>
