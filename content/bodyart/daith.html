<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><img src=daith.jpg align=left> Both of these piercings 
  were done by Cushla at Into You over a 6 month period. The upper cartilage has 
  occasionally been troublesome (after I replaced the way too small ring Cushla 
  used) but after a few months had settled down nicely. The daith was only a day 
  old when this photo was taken so it's early days yet. </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The daith grew out and had several bad infections. 
  I had it repierced eventually by Anne at Piercing Exquisite with a bigger ring, 
  placed deeper into the ear. That worked out fine.</font> </p>
