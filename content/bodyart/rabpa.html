<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Well, I just got back from Into You, the proud owner 
of a 10ga 3/4&quot; SSS CBR!<BR>
<BR>
Got to Into You about half an hour late and Mark had taken his 6pm appointment 
early, but he was finished by five past so it was my turn (I didn't recognise 
him without his bright orange hair -- too attractive for wasps he said!). I signed 
the release form, picked a ring (well, no...once I said I wanted a CBR he produced 
a 10ga 3/4&quot; and I just looked and said &quot;er, yeah&quot; :-) Paid up (20 
GBP for the pierce, 6.50 GBP for the ring). Hmm, Teena had me pay afterwards...oh 
well.<BR>
<BR>
Downstairs, I peel off and sit in the &quot;dentist's&quot; chair feeling a little 
bit ridiculous but Mark chats away putting me at ease. I'm the third PA in a row 
he's done, apparently. Teena, he says, is in Burma and likely to stay there for 
a year or so. Then we chat about Dunstable Tattoo Expo (&quot;wild&quot; says 
Mark). He dons gloves and marks me up after confirming that I 'hang to the right' 
-- 'yeah' he says 'that'll sit nicely in there'. Change of gloves and he lays 
out the needle etc -- ulp, it looks awfully big! 'Just relax and get yourself 
ready' he says 'you'll just feel a little push' I look away at this point...SHIT! 
'OK, just putting the ring in...there, you're done!' I unclench my fingers from 
the arms of the chair and look at the ring: WOW! And I only had to suffer that 
short, sharp pain for this...yeah!!!!<BR>
<BR>
Mark gets me a glass of water and a sucker and I dress and we chat some more. 
I mention that I've still got my long tongue barbell in. 'Want to change it now? 
No charge if the old one's not damaged' So he gets a smaller 14ga barbell and 
swaps it over after some minor trouble getting access to the lower thread: 'Stick 
your tongue out straight' Unngh, says me... :-)<BR>
<BR>
Yeah, it feels a lot better like that!<BR>
<BR>
'Any idea what you'll get next?' Dunno... So we discuss some other piercings and 
I leave thinking I might get a frenum next... Who said the A-word?<BR>
<BR>
So it's now about 4 hours since the pierce and, apart from some bleeding when 
I took a shower, it's fine. No discomfort (just fascination :-) and I've started 
the 'glass of warm salt water routine'...now that really is something to make 
you feel ridiculous!!<BR>
<BR>
To sum up then: I'd recommend Into You anyway having been there before. Mark is 
great -- his relaxed chatty manner really helps and he seems to take care that 
the piercing is well-placed and you're going to be happy with it. The PA is so 
much less painful than I expected -- Mark actually said 'yeah, the guy comes up 
to stick a needle in your dick and you're thinking...uh-oh, do I _really_ want 
to do this and then...it's over and you _know_ it was the right decision!' and 
I'd agree with that.<BR>

Thanx for reading... </font>
