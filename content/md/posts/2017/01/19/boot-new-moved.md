I'm pleased to announce that the "Boot new" task formerly known as `seancorfield/boot-new` has moved to the Boot organization, as [`boot-clj/boot-new`](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot-new) and that the group/artifact ID is now `boot/new`.

You can use this to easily create a new Boot-based project:

    boot -d boot/new new -t app -n my-new-boot-app
