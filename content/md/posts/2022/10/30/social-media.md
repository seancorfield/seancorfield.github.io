About a year ago I [posted that I had deleted both my Twitter and Facebook accounts](https://corfield.org/blog/2021/11/10/social-media/).

In March, my wife & I visited friends and family in England (for the first time
in three years) as my mother had been diagnosed with AAA (abdominal
aortic aneurysm) and it had grown substantially -- the doctor has given her
"months" to live, although she's already lasted longer than that!

One of the frustrations of that trip was that we ended up having to use my
wife's Facebook account to organize all the get togethers with _my_ friends
and family because, well, I'd deleted my Facebook account!

So, shortly after we got back, I bit the bullet and recreated both my
Facebook account and, grudgingly, my Twitter account as well. I was able to
use the same usernames on both and start fresh. I've kept both accounts very
"slim" in terms of followers and my experience has generally been much better
than it was, through a judicious combination of not having the apps on my
phone's home screen and not having either site in my favorites or the
"quick links" in my browser.

But they're still both "junk" really and at this point I view Facebook as
an unpleasant necessity for keeping in touch with friends and family around
the world. I do not view Twitter as a necessity of any stripe, however, and
with the recent acquisition by the world's richest idiot, I decided it was
time to find a better "home" for interacting with people.

So I've been part of the `#TwitterMigration` and I've moved to Mastodon,
like 80,000 other people did yesterday!

I've added a link to the site navigation here and my Twitter profile (and
I've changed my display name on Twitter to my Mastodon handle).

From now on, you can find me at [@seancorfield@tech.lgbt](https://tech.lgbt/@seancorfield).
Come on in, the `#fediverse` is a welcoming, fun, and interesting place to find
friends and chat.
