This is part of an ongoing series of blog posts about our ever-evolving use of the Clojure CLI,
`deps.edn`, and [Polylith](https://polylith.gitbook.io/), with our monorepo at
[World Singles Networks](https://worldsinglesnetworks.com).<!--more-->

## Part XI

In my last post -- about eight months ago -- I said we were about 86% through
our migration with 114,114 lines of code converted to Polylith. We completed
it a while back but I've been lax about writing the "final" (maybe) chapter
of this series.

We have 138,497 lines of Clojure code in Polylith now. We build 21 projects
from 21 bases and 144 components. We have 1,160 source and test files.
