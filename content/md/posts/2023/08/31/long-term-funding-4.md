In my [previous Long-Term Funding update](https://corfield.org/blog/2023/06/30/long-term-funding-3/)
I said I would review/overhaul the "ecosystem" and "tutorials" sections.<!--more-->

## `clojure-doc.org`

## Polylith

Switched from `build-clj` to `tools.build`.

## `clj-new`

1.2.404

Switched from `build-clj` to `tools.build`.

## `clj-commons`

Governance docs?

## Other Projects

## What's Next?

In September/October, I'm hoping to complete a review and update of the
"cookbooks" section of clojure-doc.org, and then in the
remaining period, I'll tackle the "language" section.

## On a personal note...

I mentioned in the previous update that my mother was back in hospital and
not doing too well. She passed away on my birthday, July 7th, and much of
my energy for the rest of the month was focused on that. She would have been
90 this coming December.
