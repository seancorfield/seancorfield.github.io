I've been on both Twitter and Facebook for a very long time
and it definitely has had its ups and downs. A couple of
times over the last six years, I've felt the need to take
a complete break from Facebook and have deactivated my
account for up to a couple of months each time. I've also
taken several breaks from Twitter, although I didn't deactivate
my account.

I've finally decided that the cons are outweighing the pros
for me on social media so I have shutdown (deleted) both my
Twitter account and my Facebook account. Permanently.

I'm tired of the noise (and the politics and hatefulness).
