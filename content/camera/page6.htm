          <p align="left">The Merridale Street premises were inexpensive and
          primitive, and in 1958 Corfield's were advised by Wolverhampton
          Council that the factory was condemned. This meant looking for a new
          home, but property was extremely expensive and difficult to find, the
          nearest available was at Redditch. They decided that if they moved so far, about 90% of their employees would not be able to stay, and
          after polling the workforce found that just as many would move to
          Northern Ireland where generous industrial development grants were
          available. All assistance to find jobs was offered to the people who chose to stay in Wolverhampton. The company even put adverts in the
          local newspapers, on behalf of their departing workforce, stating that
          a number of highly skilled people were looking for employment. The
          works closed on January 30th 1959.</p>

          <p align="left">The company moved to Ballymoney in County Antrim where
          a new factory was made ready for them. Work soon got underway and
          production of the Periflex 2 and Periflex 3 cameras restarted. Some
          local skilled labour was available, but inevitably it fell far short
          of what was required and so a lot of training was undertaken. Later
          that year the Periflex 3 was given a facelift and the Periflex 3a was
          launched. More modern looking knobs were used and a split-image
          rangefinder was added to the focusing screen. The lens was given a
          black anodised body and the adjustment rings had black and silver
          finger grips.</p>
          <p align="left">Three new Lumar and Lumax lenses were introduced. The
          first was the 85mm f1.5 Super Lumax, which had 6 fully coated elements and could focus down to 4ft. The other two were the 240mm
          f4.5 Lumar and the 400mm f4.5 Tele Lumax. Within 12 months of the
          move, production was higher than ever, which led to price reductions
          of between 5% and 10% on cameras and lenses.</p>
          <p align="left">The next camera was designed as a replacement for the
          Periflex 2. It was basically a cheaper version of the 3a, called the
          Periflex Gold Star. The main difference was the shutter, which only
          had a maximum speed of 1/300sec. At the same time the 50mm f2.4 Lumax
          lens was introduced. It sold extremely well and soon became the
          standard lens for the Gold Star.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left">The price difference between the Gold Star and the
          Periflex3a was only £15 and so most people preferred to purchase the
          cheaper Gold Star rather than pay the extra for higher shutter speeds.
          Something had to be done about this, and so the 3a was restyled to
          become the 3b. The main difference was the external metalwork which
          was given a black anodised finish instead of the usual 'silver'
          anodising.</p>

                  Periflex concept. It was to be a cheap camera that could be
                  used as a second body for existing camera users. It was
                  basically a Gold Star without the periscope viewfinder, and
                  was sold in three versions. The 'Interplan-A' had a Leica lens
                  mount, the 'Interplan-B' had a Practica lens mount, and the 'Interplan-C'
                  had an Exacta lens mount.</td>

          was a cheap camera intended to be sold in the £25 to £32 price
          range. It had no periscope and a non-interchangeable 45mm f3.5 Lumax
          lens. Only a few were made and it was not sold commercially.</p>

                <td width="231">The 1960's was a time of great change and uncertainty
          in the British camera market. High quality, reasonably priced Japanese
          cameras were starting to appear here for the first time and so
          Corfield's had to do something to counteract the threat. They decided
          to develop a high quality, fairly cheap, two and a quarter inch
          square, single lens reflex camera. The end product was the Corfield 66
          which was designed to produce twelve pictures on a standard 120 roll
          film, using a removable roll film magazine.&nbsp;</td>

                  rubberised fabric focal plane shutter with speeds from 1/10sec
                  to 1/500sec. Focussing was by a ground glass screen above the
                  instant return mirror. A focus magnifier was incorporated into
                  the viewing hood, the back and sides of which are made of
                  rubberised fabric. The
                  standard lens was a 4 element 95mm f3.5 Lumax which could
                  focus down to 4 feet. It was of excellent quality and used
                  Corfield's own bayonet mount. The camera sold for £76 and
                  initial sales were quite good.</td>
