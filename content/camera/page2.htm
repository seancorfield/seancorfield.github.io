          <p align="left">Although Sir Kenneth, his wife Betty, and John devoted all of their
          spare time to assembling the Lumimeters, they could still not keep up
          with the demand. Orders were pouring in from many photographic dealers
          and it soon became obvious that something had to be done to improve
          the situation. John decided to
          leave his job at Villiers, to work full time in what was rapidly becoming the
          family business.&nbsp;</p>

          working full time they still could not satisfy the demand. Sir Kenneth
          now decided that it was time for him to show more commitment, and leave his job
          to work
          full time on the project. They also decided to look
          for proper premises, and found a small workshop which was available in
          the old Merridale Works in Merridale Street.</td>

          <p align="left"> Although the floor space
          was only about 27ft x 15ft, the rent was quite cheap and so they
          decided to take it. The business was formed into a Limited
          Company with the two brothers as directors. Sir Kenneth was Managing
          Director, John was Technical Director, and Betty was Company
          Secretary. They soon started their first two employees who were Mrs Florence Abbiss and Mr
          Reg Simmons. K.G. Corfield Ltd was an immediate success. During 1949
          they sold 5,000 Lumimeters.</p>

                <td width="335">With the success of the Lumimeter thoughts
                  naturally turned to other products. Sir Kenneth had the
                  inspiration, and many of the ideas for the products that were
                  to follow, and John had the necessary design skills to make
                  the products a reality. The first was a hand-held
                  split image precision rangefinder called the Corfield
                  Telemeter Rangefinder. It was substantially built around a
                  die-cast, cream stove enamelled, aluminium case with black
                  leathercloth panels. The meter was held in place on the user's
                  hand by a strong elastic strap into which the fingers were
                  inserted. The two images were aligned by a lever on the
                  right-hand side which moved a red pointer across a distance
                  scale. When the two images were aligned the focus setting
                  could be read from the scale. A very bright image was produced
                  due to the large size of the rangefinder. Two versions were
                  available, one with an imperial scale of 3 to 300ft and
                  another with a metric scale of 1 to 100m.</td>

          <p align="left">The second new product was the Corfield Optical
          Exposure Meter. It used a pattern of black circular dots, divided
          into two halves of unequal brightness to measure the light level. In
          use the film speed was set and the meter was held to the eye. The knob
          was rotated until the dots in the darker half of the image
          disappeared, and the exposure time was read from a scale. This
          technique allowed accurate readings to be taken in extremely low light
          levels. The instrument was well built in a die-cast aluminium case
          with a black crackle finish.&nbsp;</p>

          <p align="left">The Lumimeter was still selling extremely well, but it
          required a lot of time and labour in&nbsp; its construction, and so it
          was now time for a complete redesign. The new version, the Lumimeter
          MK2 was not only easier to manufacture, but was simpler and quicker to
          use and looked very professional. It was easier to construct because
          it was housed in a one-piece sheet metal body with plastic sides. All
          that had to be done to assemble the case was to insert and tighten a
          tie rod which held the sides in position.&nbsp;</p>

                <td width="315"> In use the paper speed was
          set by rotating the pointer on the front of the instrument, and the
          Lumimeter was moved on the enlarger baseboard until the darkest part
          of the negative could be viewed on a photometric spot in the centre of
          its screen. The knob was then rotated until the spot disappeared and
          the exposure was read from a scale. The exposure scale was from 1 to
                  240 seconds, and the case was finished in a smooth black
                  wrinkle finish.&nbsp;</td>

          was an instant success, appealing to both amateurs and professionals

          units.</p>

                  short exposures was ensured by arranging the lamps to glow
                  dull red when not printing. A novel feature was that it was possible to
          insert shading devices beneath the negative.</td>

          darkroom, appeared in 1952. It was the Corfield 2 x 2 Slide Projector.
                  The slim
          die-cast body was finished in grey crinkled enamel, and illumination was
          provided by a 250 or 300 watt lamp. Ventilation slots were
                  incorporated in the top and a Chance O.N.20 heat filter was
                  positioned behind the slide. The f3.7 four element lens had a
                  focal length of three and three quarter inches and was of excellent
          quality.&nbsp;</td>

          <p align="left">The selling price was £14.18s.6d for the 250 watt
          version and £15.3s.6d for&nbsp; the 300 watt version. Sadly it got rather hot after about half an hour, and didn't
          sell very well. After a little while it was discontinued.</p>

          European photographic equipment including Stag timers, Omnica carrying
          cases, Exakta cameras and Leidox cameras. Their wide product range can be seen from the
