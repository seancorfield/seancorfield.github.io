          <font size="4">Endings and New Beginnings</font></font></strong></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">Relatively cheap, high
          quality Japanese cameras were now appearing in most U.K. camera shops
          and in response to this the major German manufacturers reduced their
          prices. Corfield's realised that in order to survive they needed a
          large injection of capital so that they could improve their existing
          facilities and produce a camera that could successfully compete with
          the new competition. Unfortunately in the early 1960's investors were
          few and far between. Fortunately, Guinness the Irish brewer was
          looking for investments in Northern Ireland and so Corfields made an
          approach.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000"> Eventually an agreement with Guinness was reached which
          would allow Corfields to carry on producing cameras and give them the
          much needed development costs for a new model. The down side was that
          Guinness would take a majority shareholding and appoint their own
          chairman of the Board of Directors, leaving Sir Kenneth as Managing
          Director. They also required Corfields to produce components for the
          metal kegs which they had just started to use.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">Sir Kenneth soon left
          the company and John was appointed Managing
          Director. He advised the board that the sum they were prepared to pay
          for new camera development was insufficient to restore the company's
          position as a leading camera manufacturer. This was due to the
          technological and cost-cutting advances that had recently been made by
          the Japanese and German manufacturers.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">Sadly the changing
          competition from abroad now meant that the company could not
          realistically compete as a camera manufacturer and so a new direction
          had to be found. John went to America and negotiated a license to
          manufacture and market the Prestolite range of alternators and voltage
          regulators for motor vehicles.</font></p>

                <td width="50%"><font size="3">Designed originally for large
                  American cars, the Prestolite alternator is becoming
                  increasingly prominent in the British commercial field because
                  of its superior specification. Take any similarly priced
                  machine and you will see that the Corfield Prestolite offers
                  higher rated precision bearings at both ends of a larger
                  diameter parallel ground shaft. The small cylindrical
                  sliprings increase the brush life by virtue of their lower
                  surface speed. The six silicon rectifiers face inwards to
                  ensure efficient cooling without risk of terminal
                  contamination. By meeting all electrical demands at
                  comparatively low engine speeds, the Prestolite Alternator
                  prevents battery drain and subsequent damage, at the same time
                  maintaining full circuit voltage to improve the power of
                  lights and auxiliaries. Alternators are essential. Prestolite
                  Alternators are a luxury for which you pay no more.</font> <font size="3">Full
                  Information on Corfield Prestolite Alternators is readily
                  available from any of the Simms Branches listed on this
                  leaflet.</font></td>

          <p align="left">John continued as Managing Director for another seven
          years, and finally moved back to England, having accepted the position
          of CEO with an aircraft components firm that had been losing money and
          needed turning around. It took him less than a year to achieve this
          goal and so he moved on to become Managing Director of an
          American-owned company that made and supplied switchgear throughout
          Europe. After seventeen years he retired, and now lives in Devon.</p>
          <p align="left">K. G. Corfield Limited<font size="3" color="#000000"> continued for another
          3 years, but finally closed
          in July 1971.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">At the end of camera
          production Mr. Stanley Corfield Senior retired for a second time and his son Stan
          went to Australia for a few years to be with his children. On his
          return to England he also retired.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">Sir Kenneth has since
          had a distinguished career. When he left Northern Ireland he became
          Executive Director of Parkinson Cowan and in 1967 became Executive
          Assistant to the President of I.T.T. Europe. He was appointed General
          Manager of the I.T.T. components group in 1968 and soon became Vice
          President and Director of I.T.T. Europe. In 1970 he became Managing
          Director of S.T.C. and in 1974 was elected Deputy Chairman to the
          Board of S.T.C., and appointed Senior Officer for I.T.T. U.K. He
          became Chairman and Chief Executive of S.T.C. in 1979. In 1980 he was
          awarded a Knighthood for his services to export.</font></p>
          <p align="left">Few people have had as much of an impact as Sir
          Kenneth on the British photographic industry. Thankfully he is still
          involved in this area today.</p>

                <td width="50%"><font size="3" color="#000000">Sir Kenneth never
                  forgot his roots. When he found it impossible to purchase a
                  suitable camera for photographing buildings in a confined
                  space, he decided to make one. The camera is called the
                  Architect. It has a rising front, and uses the 6x7cm format which gives 10 exposures
                  on a 120 roll film. It has an interchangeable back and a 47mm
                  f5.6 Schneider Super Angulon lens which gives a very wide
                  field of view.&nbsp; In true Corfield style this camera is now
                  manufactured. Sir Kenneth has again set up K. G. Corfield Ltd
                  to produce them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>

          <p align="left">Sir Kenneth's involvement in the photographic industry
          doesn't end there. In the early years of the last century, the
          Gandolfi family started to make high quality, large format, wood and
          brass cameras. These were so good that the demand for them has never
          ceased. A few years ago the last two Gandolfi brothers who ran the
          business, decided to retire. Sir Kenneth felt very sad that
          these excellent products would no longer be available. He decided to
          employ&nbsp; a few people to carry on repairing and building them.</p>
          <p align="left"> <font size="3" color="#000000"> Sir Kenneth is an excellent businessman who can always spot a gap in the
          market, and knows how to fill it. His design skills are second to
          none. When everyone said it couldn't be done, he went ahead and did
          it. He pioneered the use of new materials such as adhesives, which are
          in common use today. His management skills at Wolverhampton were first
          class, and produced a happy and highly
          motivated workforce</font></p>
          <p align="left">Sadly many people have forgotten, or are too young to
          have heard of&nbsp; the excellent cameras that were made here in
          Wolverhampton. The people that I have spoken to about this, who do
          remember Corfields, are still enthusiastic, and fondly remember those
          wonderful products. I hope that this story will help to put K. G.
          Corfield Ltd back in the minds of&nbsp; Wolverhampton people, where it
          belongs.&nbsp;</p>
