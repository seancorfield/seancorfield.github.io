          <font size="4">The Periflex Era</font></font></strong></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">Sir Kenneth began to
          think about the possibility of producing a camera. The initial idea
          was to produce a subminiature version of a 35mm camera using a 16mm
          film cassette. A lot of development work was carried out, but it became
          obvious that the concept was wrong. Such a camera would only sell in
          comparatively small numbers and only a few dealers would stock, or
          even print from, the film in the unique format. The project was
          dropped, but the seed had been sown, and soon thoughts turned towards
          a camera using 35mm film.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">The initial concept was
          to produce an economically priced, high quality 35mm camera body with
          a focal plane shutter and a Leica lens mount, so that Leica owners
          could purchase one for use as a second body. Another consideration was
          that at the time there were a lot of second hand Leica lenses on the
          market. This would make it possible for someone to purchase the camera
          and a Leica lens, and end up with a high quality camera at an
          economical price.&nbsp;In the early 1950's, import restrictions meant
          that new Leica equipment was in short supply in the shops. A lot of manufacturers were
          producing all kinds of accessories for Leica cameras, as it was often
          very difficult to obtain the genuine article . It was possible to purchase almost any
          accessory, but this was the first time that anyone had attempted to
          offer a cheaper alternative to the camera body itself.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">Work quickly got
          underway. Many of the parts were made from aluminium instead of the
          usual brass, as this was both cheaper and easier to manufacture. The
          shutter was designed to work from a thirtieth to a thousandth of a
          second using a fixed tension blind with a variable slit. It was made
          from rubberised fabric. A glass film
          pressure plate was incorporated as it was easy to polish and avoided
          film scratches. Another innovation was the sprocket-less film
          transport which simplified the wind-on mechanism and avoided jamming.
          It had been decided to include some kind of reflex focussing system.
          The difficulty was to fit it in the small confined space above the
          shutter. Sir Kenneth's solution was to use a small periscope which
          could be lowered behind the lens for focussing. This would allow the
          user to view the central part of the image through the lens and so
          focus the image. The periscope was then retracted and the photograph
          taken. A separate conventional viewfinder was provided to compose the
          image.&nbsp;</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">The Corfields were
          delighted with their new camera. The final design was so good that it
          could easily compete with the competition as a product in its own
          right. To sell it as just a camera body would severely limit its
          potential in the marketplace, and so it was now time to find a
          suitable lens. Initially the leading UK lens manufacturers were
          contacted, but not one of them could produce a quality product at the
          right price. The next step was to contact the European manufacturers,
          but this became unnecessary after Sir Kenneth was introduced to
          Frederick Archenhold. He was an experienced optician who worked for
          the British Optical Lens Co. in Walsall. He suggested that Corfields
          could make the mount and his company could make the lenses. They had
          just installed new lens coating equipment and could easily mass
          produce lenses to a high standard. After some thought Sir Kenneth
          decided that this was a good option, and gave Frederick the go ahead to
          design the optics and provide Corfields with a specification for the
          mount. The lens mount and body were made of aluminium which could be
          polished to provide a similar finish to the satin chrome finish which
          was popular at the time. The new lens was called the Lumar and initial
          prototypes performed extremely well.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">New production
          facilities were now required to manufacture the camera and lens.
          Luckily the company was able to purchase one of its immediate
          neighbours in Merridale Works to provide the much needed extra space.
          New machinery was soon installed and everything was made ready for
          production to begin. The first cameras had black anodised top and
          bottom plates, and were finished in pigskin. The camera was named after
          its unique periscope focussing mechanism and was called the Periflex.&nbsp;
          John's workload was lightened during this expansion as he appointed
          Eric Isles as technical assistant, and Gerry Whitton as toolmaker.
          Prior to this John had personally designed, drawn and dimensioned
          every component, and made all of the tools for the various products.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">The first the public
          heard of the camera was a pre-launch article which appeared in the
          January 28th, 1953 edition of Amateur Photographer. It consisted of
          advance details supplied by Corfields and looked forward to the
          appearance of the camera. The edition of May 20th was the first to
          announce the arrival of the new camera. The write-up
          included the following:</font></p>
          <p align="left"><i><font size="3" color="#000000">The camera has a
          somewhat Leitz body style, but different in having the periscope
          eyepiece and the unusual tan pigskin covering. The body is constructed
          of 16 s.w.g. light alloy, has a removable back and base. Equipped with
          a Leica thread lens mount, collimation had been carried out to a high
          degree of accuracy to suit the widest apertures - plus or minus
          0.0004in from flange to the face of the film plane. The camera was
          very comfortable in the hand, with the shutter release being placed on
          the front of the body in a natural position for the index finger of
          the right hand. Around the shutter release was a removable collar
          which, when unscrewed, would allow the fitting of a Leitz cable
          release. Flash synchronisation was provided by the standard 3mm
          co-axial socket. The prices were quoted as: body only £19.19.6d, with
          50mm f3.5 Lumar lens - uncoated, £29.18s.6d, or coated £32.19s.6d.</font></i></p>
          <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">The write-up was a
          great success. As soon as the magazine reached the shops orders
          started pouring in. It had only been planned to initially produce
          between 25 to 30 units each week, and so the sudden demand came as a
          bit of a shock. It took sometime to build up production, particularly
          as the employees had to be trained in a lot of new skills.&nbsp;</font></p>

          approximately 18 months the camera underwent some cosmetic changes.
          The top and bottom plates were silver anodised aluminium and the lens barrel
          was simplified. Black leather strips were added to the adjustment
          rings to allow the user to firmly grip them. These changes brightened
                  up the appearance of the camera, and gave it a more modern
          look.&nbsp;</font></td>
