<font face="Comic Sans MS"> This was my second year at Dunstable. Last year I 
went on Sunday - the open day - which was fairly lively. I felt rather out of 
place with only a couple of piercings and no tats. This year I returned, on competition 
day, well-poked and slightly inked and had... well, quite a good day. Without 
the good company of some fellow r.a.b.bits, it would've been a dull day indeed. 
Next year will see a return to open day I think!<BR>

<div align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The following images caught my 
  eye during the day:<BR>
  </font> 
  <TABLE WIDTH=440>
    <TR> 
      <TD ALIGN=LEFT> <font face="Comic Sans MS"><IMG SRC="heavy.jpg" WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="288" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"></font></TD>
      <TD ALIGN=RIGHT><font face="Comic Sans MS"><IMG SRC="winner.jpg" WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="288" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"></font></TD>
    </TR>
  </TABLE>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure who the guy on the left is but he had 
  some beautiful designs covering much of his body and enough piercings to sink 
  a battleship. The arm on the right belongs to the winner of the ladies' celtic 
  / tribal category and the blurry photograph doesn't do it justice at all!<BR>
  </font> </div>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">My companions for most of the day were Joe Tye (can't 
wait to see your chest piece complete!), Lucy Rother (Girls Rule!), Jewels (Iban 
fanatic) and Wereric (who can't find the tattoo he wants).<BR>
<BR>
Next year, let's try and see a few more r.a..b.bits there, OK?<BR>
