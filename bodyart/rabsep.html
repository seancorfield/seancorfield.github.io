<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"> Asgard in Southampton is right next to a rest/care 
  home. It's slightly disconcerting to see the same colours/fonts on the body 
  piercing sign as on the care home sign on the other side of the driveway. &quot;Knock 
  loudly&quot; it says on the door but I sort of knocked and opened the door and 
  it opens onto a kitchen...</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Warwick and Angie greeted us (me and my friend <A HREF="http://www.soton.ac.uk/~rpevtzow">Rachel</A>) 
  and led us upstairs to the studio. Big case full of jewellery -- some really 
  nice niobium rings -- pretty much everything is CBRs and all made on the premises. 
  I want my septum done at 10ga and I want a retainer. Warwick doesn't have one 
  so he goes off to the workshop to make one. Rachel's having her navel pierced 
  and Angie went through the patter about sterile field etc (Rachel will post 
  separately her view of this!). Angie using a freezing spray and Rachel says 
  it hurt more than the pierce.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Warwick returns with the freshly minted U-shaped 
  retainer and autoclaves it. It'll be about half an hour so we go downstairs 
  to the lounge where Warwick tries to make us coffee in between handling phone 
  calls and two navel jewellery changes. The lounge is not a sight for animal 
  rights folks: the walls are lined with stuffed birds and guns and shooting trophies 
  feature largely... A thin blonde called Naomi, an aerobics instructor, comes 
  in and gets her &quot;belly button&quot; pierced... She's not too impressed 
  with our tongue pierces etc etc poor girl... Warwick did five navels before 
  lunch and then lost count :-) We finally get the coffee and fend off the attentions 
  of Kim the puppy but not until she'd already jumped on my groin and clawed at 
  my nipple ring which was already playing up... do dogs have piercing radar or 
  what????</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Autoclave's done so back upstairs. Warwick checks 
  the shape of my nose and then clamps and pierces. Did it hurt? Er, no, actually 
  and I was kinda disappointed... my eyes didn't even water. Well, OK, just a 
  bit as he put the retainer in.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Before the pierce, he had warned me that it's hard 
  to get the septum level but said that he will re-pierce (f.o.c. I guess) if 
  I'm not happy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we went back downstairs and chatted to Warwick 
  for about half an hour about his business and stuff. He's a nice friendly guy 
  but the work-from-home aspect of the studio is a little unnerving (for me, at 
  least). As we leave he shakes our hands and says it's nice to pierce people 
  who are into it rather than just a fashion thing. Ahhhh.... :-)</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">After, we went out for a chinese and then saw a 
  movie and, I'm afraid, I kept fiddling with the retainer... it feels really 
  strange and, no, it isn't straight but it's difficult to tell how crooked it 
  is yet. It *looks* pretty uneven but we'll see...</font> </p>
