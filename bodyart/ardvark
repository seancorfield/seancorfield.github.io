Subject: The magical, moving web-site! Please adjust.Date: Tue, 24 Dec 1996 07:43:25 +0000From: ardvark@slip.net (Anne Greenblatt) (by way of sean@ocsltd.com (Sean A     Corfield)) (by way of sean@ocsltd.com (Sean A Corfield))To: sean@ocsltd.comGreetings.The reason you're getting this (form) letter is because you have beenidentified as having at least one link to Anne "Ardvark" Greenblatt's website, formerly at http://www.c2.org/~ardvark.  My name is Dan Greenblatt,and I'm Ardvark's hubby and web maintainer.  Ardvark herself would bewriting to you, but she's on vacation in Canada and won't be back for a fewmore days.Recently, we've had some problems with our ISP and have been forced to moveto another ISP.  I won't go into those details here, other than to say thatISPs who decide to go out of business really suck.  'Nuff said.  Suffice itto say that our site is no longer accessible at the above address, andthey're dragging their heels on setting up a redirection to the new site.We have a carbon copy of the old site up and running at our new server.Please adjust your references tohttp://www.c2.org/~ardvarkto readhttp://www2.ba.best.com/~ardvarkThank you very much.  And, thank you also for all the traffic you've givenour site over the past nine months.  Now that we have an ISP that knowswhat they're doing, hopefully things will be relatively permanent (until weget that vanity-plate-of-the-net, the custom domain name.)Sincerely,---Dan Greenblatt, surrogate Ardvark                                 * Ardvark *                              Anne  Greenblatt                  Piercing FAQ Manager for rec.arts.bodyart                             Piercing Exquisite                         http://www.c2.org/~ardvark
