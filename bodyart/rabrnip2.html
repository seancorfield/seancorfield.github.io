<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Thanx to those who responded recently to my query 
about how long I should wait before getting my nip redone. On Saturday, I decided 
to take the old ring out *sniff* ... but I had a final bit of fun cleaning the 
pierce: I squirted saline through it (from a contact lens bottle) and had a chuckle 
as it came straight out the other side :-) </font>
<P><font face="Comic Sans MS">(OK, little things please little minds...) </font>
<P><font face="Comic Sans MS">Today I was at the <A HREF="http://www.bme.freeq.com/pierce/lpcafter.html">London 
  Piercing Clinic</A>, run by Patrick, and he repierced the nipple. He uses a 
  fairly different technique to what I'm used to so it was an interesting experience... 
  </font>
<P><font face="Comic Sans MS">The clinic: Patrick's piercing room is a purpose-fitted 
  room behind his house. It all seemed very clean -- all the necessary equipment 
  was clearly visible. </font>
<P><font face="Comic Sans MS">Patrick prefers to use anaesthetic. I've never had 
  anaesthetic before so this was new. He also never uses clamps, preferring to 
  hold the area with his fingers. </font>
<P><font face="Comic Sans MS">He cleaned the nipple, injected a small amount of 
  anaesthetic. Then he selected a titanium 10ga 3/4&quot; CBR -- Patrick only 
  uses titanium for fresh piercings because of possible allergic reactions he 
  says. </font>
<P><font face="Comic Sans MS">Then he selected a needle, held the nipple tightly 
  and pushed the needle through. Apart from a slightly strange sensation, I didn't 
  feel a thing. (which in itself was odd for me...!) </font>
<P><font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a look at this point... Hmm, a large needle 
  sticking through my nip... how nice :-/ </font>
<P><font face="Comic Sans MS">Then he slipped the ring through behind the needle 
  and that was it. </font>
<P><font face="Comic Sans MS">Patrick is very fast with his fingers and the placement 
  of the ring is exactly what I wanted, right at the base of the nipple (which 
  is a couple of mm behind where the previous holes were). This should be fine 
  for fairly rough play once it's healed. </font>
<P><font face="Comic Sans MS">His recommended cleaning regime is warm saline twice 
  a day, followed by a couple of drops of diluted tree tea oil. All piercees get 
  a small bottle of prediluted oil along with an aftercare sheet. </font>
<P><font face="Comic Sans MS">During the afternoon I spent with Patrick (and his 
  wife and some friends), I saw quite a lot of custom come and go home happy. 
  He also did both of my friend's nipples and she enjoyed the experience. Many 
  of the customers are repeat business (although he's doing a lot of navels right 
  now... as is almost every piercer in Britain I think!) </font>
<P><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm pretty pleased with Patrick. He has a nice relaxing, 
  no-nonsense manner and I'm sure I'll use him again... in fact, he was very keen 
  to discuss whatever bodmods I might want to put together in future. </font>
